## [Unreleased]

### Added
<!-- New features go here -->

### Changed
<!-- Changes to existing functionality go here -->

### Fixed
- Open file tabs no longer disappear when switching between tasks/sessions/files. The `WorkstreamEditorTabs` restore effect was running on mount before `workstreamStatesLoadedAtom` had hydrated from disk, reading `openFilePaths: []` (the atom default), restoring zero tabs, and marking restore complete. The persist effect then immediately wrote the empty list back to workspace state, replacing the saved tab list. The restore effect now also waits on `workstreamStatesLoadedAtom === true` (same hydration guard `AgentWorkstreamPanel` already uses for child sessions) before reading `openFilePaths`, so a not-yet-hydrated mount no longer overwrites saved state. Fixes #169.
- Settings → Claude Agent SDK panel no longer reads `Version: unknown` on builds where npm workspace dedup hoists `@anthropic-ai/claude-agent-sdk` to the repo-root `node_modules/`. The build-time version read in `electron.vite.config.ts` was hardcoded to `packages/electron/node_modules/...` and silently fell through to `'unknown'` on hoisted installs; it now tries both the local and workspace-root candidates. Closes #60.

## [0.59.1] - 2026-05-06


### Added
- Render Codex `file_change` tool calls as inline red/green edit cards in the transcript, matching how Claude's `Edit` tool already renders. Mints stable synthetic edit-group IDs (`nimtc|...`) for Codex tool calls so reused per-turn item IDs don't collapse separate edits, plumbs the synthetic ID through `SessionFileTracker`, the canonical transcript event, local-history pre-edit tags, and `ToolCallMatcher`, adds a `CodexEditWindowRegistry` to attribute observed file writes to the right tool call without depending on upstream pre-edit hooks, drops `file_change` from the custom-widget registry (was rendering as a snapshot summary), and dispatches through a new `AsyncEditToolResultCard` that fetches diffs via `getToolCallDiffs` and renders through the existing `EditToolResultCard`. Adds a real-AI E2E spec gated on `RUN_REAL_CODEX=1`.
- Privileged `collab-asset://` scheme for E2E-encrypted attachments in collaborative documents. Drag/drop and paste of images into collaborative docs were failing with `TypeError: Failed to fetch` because the production sync worker's CORS allowlist excludes the renderer's dev/packaged origins. Main now fetches and decrypts asset bytes and serves them back to the renderer same-origin, so `webSecurity:true` stays on and CORS is no longer in the renderer's path. Adds per-WebContents auth gate on the new `upload-asset`, `gc-assets`, and `close-doc` IPCs (`event.sender.id` check) so a renderer in window A cannot operate on a doc only window B has opened. Asset GC reports only URIs that disappeared from the live editor state since the last scan; main deletes exactly those, so a peer's still-live attachment can never be deleted by another client whose Yjs sync hasn't converged yet. Per-asset key fingerprint and `rotated_at` columns on `document_assets` let team key rotation skip already-rotated assets and resume cleanly after partial failure. Slims `CollabAssetService` down to an IPC facade and adds a minimal `CollabAssetLinkPlugin` so `collab-asset://` anchor clicks still open in editable mode. Adds staging R2 binding for `DOCUMENT_ASSETS`.
- Voice agent can now create a new coding session on demand via a new `create_session` MCP tool, and the new session becomes the active linked session automatically so subsequent `submit_agent_prompt` and `ask_coding_agent` calls target it without an extra navigation step.
- Show a delayed finish timestamp on completed transcript turn summaries, including full prior-day dates with formatting tests.
- Tracker MCP tools now expose schema introspection and validation (`tracker_define_type` schema fields surfaced through MCP tools) (NIM-371).
- New `tracker_unlink_session` MCP tool for removing a tracker-to-session link.
- Existing-session tracker link flow: surface and choose an existing session when linking a tracker item, instead of only the ambient AI session.

### Changed
- Upgrade bundled `@openai/codex-sdk` to 0.128.0 across the Electron and runtime workspaces; refresh lockfile entries so packaged Codex binaries resolve consistently. Earlier in the cycle bumped bundled Codex to 0.124.0.
- Refine the collabv3 metrics dashboard: track the DO's stable `id` as `blob2` for `session_sync` and `message_append` events so `COUNT(DISTINCT blob2)` reports unique sessions; replace the unsupported `wallTime` field with `cpuTime` only on the DO compute time chart; switch the DO subrequests chart to response bytes (egress) using `responseBodySize` (`requests`/`subrequests` does not exist on `durableObjectsSubrequestsAdaptiveGroups`); switch the SQLite database size chart from `durableObjectsStorageGroups` (legacy KV-backed, always 0 for SQLite-backed DOs) to `durableObjectsSqlStorageGroups` and stack per-namespace; rewrite the team membership growth query to `GROUP BY day, index1` because Cloudflare Analytics Engine SQL does not support `CASE WHEN`.
- Restore optional email collection in analytics. Onboarding and Stytch sign-in deliberately set email; the prior scrubber was no longer compatible and not really needed.
- Gate local-to-shared tracker upgrades behind explicit confirmation so a local tracker isn't accidentally promoted to a shared/team-synced item (NIM-364).
- `tracker_create` no longer auto-links the calling AI session. Agents must pass `linkSession: true` (or call `tracker_link_session` afterward) to create a link, stopping sessions from accumulating unrelated tracker items the agent created as side effects (NIM-408).
- `tracker_link_session` MCP tool now accepts an optional explicit `sessionId` arg (falls back to the ambient session when omitted), validates the explicit `sessionId` exists in `ai_sessions`, and echoes the resolved `sessionId` in the structured response (NIM-405).

### Fixed
- Default `CLAUDE_CODE_ENTRYPOINT` to `'cli'` so OAuth subscription traffic (Pro and Max) is not classified as third-party by Anthropic's backend. The bundled `@anthropic-ai/claude-agent-sdk` defaults SDK consumers to `'sdk-ts'` when the env var is unset, which was sending Nimbalyst into a deprioritized throttle lane that fired before the user's documented usage quota was reached, especially when the official `claude` CLI was running concurrently under the same OAuth credentials. One-line conditional override in `sdkOptionsBuilder.ts`, conditional spread shape so any caller who explicitly sets the env var (e.g., for hook-policy enforcement per anthropics/claude-code#54541, or debugging) keeps their value. Closes #174.
- Open a workspace whose `.git` repo has zero commits yet without spamming a multi-line stack trace into `main.log`. `GitRefWatcher.start` was letting the "fatal: your current branch X does not have any commits yet" error from `simple-git`'s `log()` call escape into the outer catch as `[GitRefWatcher] Failed to start watching: ...`. The pre-flight branch + HEAD lookup is now wrapped in a narrow try/catch that pattern-matches that exact error, logs a one-line info message, and returns cleanly. All other errors still surface to the outer catch unchanged. Mirrors the existing detached-HEAD short-circuit. Adds unit tests for the empty-repo, unrelated-error, and detached-HEAD paths.
- Refresh the editor on AI edits when the pre-edit IPC outruns the disk write. The renderer reads disk on `history:pending-tag-created` to set up the diff session, but Claude's `AgentToolHooks` fires the pre-edit signal before its own write and Codex's chokidar event can outrun the OS write. In both cases `info.content` equalled the baseline, so `DocumentModel` created an empty-diff `DiffSession` locked into `'applying'` phase and the open tab froze on the pre-edit content while disk had the new bytes. Skip session creation when the first payload matches the baseline; the next file-changed-on-disk event arrives with the actual new content and creates the session correctly.
- Render sub-bullet-with-link diffs cleanly. Three stacked bugs caused 1 red + 2 green duplicates plus an orphaned red `URL:` placeholder on `small.md`. `TreeMatcher` emitted duplicate UPDATE diffs when a forced guidepost equal collided with TOPT's own equal/replace on the same source/target pair; source clones from a live editor had `AutoLinkNode`s while the headless target editor parsed bare URLs as plain text, so structural mismatch made unchanged bullets look "similar" and recursion duplicated them; `ListDiffHandler` removed children left-to-right, triggering `@lexical/list`'s `mergeLists`. `diffUtils` now applies the same URL/email wrapping to the target before tree matching, removals run in reverse, `serializedNodesEqual` normalizes direction `"ltr"` vs `null`, and the brittle all-children-identical short-circuit is replaced with an anchored prefix/suffix + pairwise-middle inline diff. Adds Playwright E2E with screenshot evidence and inline-diff regressions.
- Stabilize Codex edit attribution by reusing Codex synthetic edit-group IDs in raw tool matching and delaying watcher fallback briefly so `file_change` windows win races.
- Centralize tracker session link visibility through shared rules so the same link visibility behavior applies in MCP handlers.
- Restore meta-agent session history actions: add session context menus to meta-agent rows in session history, and keep meta-agent archive and delete scoped to the full group.
- Track the real `sessionId` in collabv3 analytics. `SessionRoom`'s `session_sync` and `message_append` events now pass the DO's stable id (`this.state.id.toString()`) as `blob2` instead of empty string / per-message id, unblocking accurate "sessions per day", "total unique sessions", and per-session aggregations on the metrics dashboard.
- Keep auto-committed widgets visually committed when the auto-commit toggle flips off. Latches `wasAutoCommitted` so the success UI stays after auto-commit is later disabled, instead of reverting to the pending interactive widget even though the commit already happened. Replaces the one-shot "Disable auto-approve" link in the success widget with a proper checkbox so users can toggle auto-approval on or off for future commits at any time.
- Keep shared tracker session links local-only so a tracker shared with a team doesn't leak per-user session links to other members (NIM-368).
- Initialize the tracker session linking UI on first load so the link control renders correctly without requiring a refresh (NIM-407).
- Restore meta-agent MCP tools for Codex sessions by allowing internal meta-agent MCP tools in the Codex SDK allowlist; adds regression coverage for meta-agent session tool options.
- Stop cross-window session reload pollution. The `ai:messages-logged-batch` event was fanning out via `BrowserWindow.getAllWindows()`, so every window reacted to every other window's session activity, producing a steady stream of `[SessionManager] Rejecting session ... belongs to /A, not /B` warnings during streaming in any sibling window. Routes the batch broadcast to only the window owning the session's workspace via cached `sessionId -> workspacePath` lookup, carries `workspacePath` on the batch payload so the renderer can attribute the event without a registry lookup, and tightens renderer guards in `handleMessageLogged` and `handleStateChange` to drop events that aren't attributable to this window's workspace instead of falling back to `currentWorkspacePath`.
- Preserve local tracker typing during MCP refresh races so an in-flight user edit isn't clobbered by a concurrent MCP-driven refresh.
- Restore `@` mentions for `nimbalyst-local` plans, which were no longer surfacing in the mention picker.
- Stop MCP `tracker_update` from clobbering collab Y.Doc bodies. For team-synced native tracker items the rich body lives in a Yjs document keyed by `tracker-content/{itemId}`, not in PGLite. MCP's `tracker_update` was writing the description straight into the PGLite content column, which the renderer's next debounced save silently overwrote with the unchanged Y.Doc state -- the AI write was lost without surfacing any error. Detect collab body items (native + shared/hybrid sync policy + tracker sync active for the workspace) and refuse description writes through both the explicit `args.description` path and the generic `args.fields.description` bag. Other field updates flow through normally so status / priority / etc. still sync via the JSONB LWW path. The skipped write is reported back to the agent in `structured.skippedFields` plus a clear summary line (NIM-436).
- Stop tracker reads/writes from corrupting `automationStatus`. The Apr 20 fix for NIM-324 left two destructive paths in place: `detectTrackerFromFrontmatter` merged stale top-level fields over the fresh nested block, and `updateTrackerInFrontmatter` ignored the caller's `updates` argument entirely for extension-owned files. Reverses the read merge so the nested block wins on overlap while non-shadowed top-level fields (workflow status, tags, timestamps) are still surfaced; on write, routes caller updates to top-level for fields the nested block does not own, drops updates targeting nested-owned fields, and keeps stripping stale top-level duplicates. Fixes NIM-324.
- Apply the Claude Code `[^a-zA-Z0-9]` path encoder to the importer (`ClaudeCodeSessionSync.ts`) so workspace paths with spaces, apostrophes, or other non-alphanumeric characters resolve to the same on-disk directory the scanner uses, instead of failing with ENOENT for every session. Also surfaces failures: when every session fails, `claude-code:sync-sessions` now returns `success: false` with the first error so the renderer's existing error path renders the failure instead of closing the dialog with no feedback. Fixes #170.
- Thread persisted `fieldUpdatedAt` through tracker upload so batch and recovery uploads from PGLite no longer claim all fields were "just edited" on the upload path, making field-level LWW merge deterministic between users. `buildPayloadsFromRows` now reads `data._fieldUpdatedAt` from the JSONB column and assigns it to `item.fieldUpdatedAt` before converting to a payload; `rowToTrackerItem` stops leaking `_fieldUpdatedAt` into `customFields` (NIM-246).
- Refresh the tracker detail editor on external content updates. The Lexical body in `TrackerItemDetail` loaded once on mount and never re-read when MCP `tracker_update` wrote new content -- the row in PGLite was correct but the panel rendered the pre-update markdown until the app was reloaded. Watches the per-item atom for content changes that diverge from the baseline this panel persisted, and remounts the local-pglite editor via a key epoch so it adopts the new `initialContent`. Fixes NIM-433.
- Extract Codex child output in meta-agent session results. `MetaAgentService.get_session_result` returned null `lastResponse`, empty `recentMessages`, empty `userPrompts`, and null `originalPrompt` for any child session running on `openai-codex`. `extractMessageText` only recognized Claude's shape, and `extractUserPrompts` required `JSON.parse(content).prompt` to succeed. Both now handle Codex shapes (`item.completed`/`updated` for `agent_message` and reasoning items, `event_msg` payloads, root-level delta and bare text, `task_complete`) and skip rows tagged `metadata.promptType === 'system_reminder'` so session-naming nudges no longer leak into parent notifications. 27 unit tests cover Claude shapes, all the new Codex shapes, system-reminder filtering, and edge cases (#145).

### Removed
- Remove the obsolete `AssetLinkPlugin`, superseded by `CollabAssetLinkPlugin`. The file was missing from the `collab-asset://` commit's file list so the deletion was skipped; no imports remain.

## [0.59.0] - 2026-05-05


### Added
- Peek file diffs from the git log commit detail panel. Click a file in the selected commit's detail panel to pin its unified diff in the existing peek popover; Up/Down steps through files while pinned, Esc closes. Diffs come from `git show` via a new `git:commit-file-diff` IPC handler, and the popover reuses the size persisted by the changes panel and commit proposal widget.

### Changed
- Migrate alpha auto-updates from the legacy R2 feed to GitHub prereleases. Adds cumulative public-release promotion commands and updates the release docs.
- Centralize PGLite TIMESTAMPTZ handling to epoch-ms via `toMillis`, normalizing how all timestamps cross the SQL/JS boundary (#147).

### Fixed
- Match Claude Code's `[^a-zA-Z0-9]` path encoder when scanning workspace-filtered session imports so project paths containing spaces, apostrophes, dots, or accented characters resolve to the same on-disk directory Claude wrote to. Extracts an `encodeWorkspaceDir()` helper mirroring the upstream regex exactly with unit tests covering slashes, spaces, apostrophes, accented characters, dots/underscores, and dash preservation.
- Bump the parent's `childCount` in the session registry when a child session is added so SessionHistory's left-pane workstream tree reveals new children (e.g. from `/launch-new-session`) without a manual disclosure toggle or unrelated mutation. `createChildSessionAtom` now uses `Math.max` against the registry's current value so a stale per-parent atom can't mask a new child. Refs NIM-435.
- Coalesce `ai_agent_messages` writes through a single FIFO `AgentMessageWriteQueue` that batches multi-row INSERTs on a 200ms idle window or 200-row threshold, cutting writer-lock p95 blocked time from ~330ms to ~1ms during long Claude Code turns and unblocking the awaited `can_use_tool` permission audit that was hitting "Tool permission request failed: Error: Stream closed". Adds `createMany()` to `AgentMessagesRepository`, the PGLite store, and the synced wrapper; routes `BaseAIProvider.logAgentMessage` and the non-blocking variant through the shared queue; emits `ai:messages-logged-batch` per affected session per flush so the renderer's throttled reload and unread-marking path stays current; and adds `WRITE_QUEUE_PRESSURE` telemetry on depth>500 or multi-row batches >200ms. Fixes #163, refs NIM-340/NIM-431.
- Stop word-level inline diff from interleaving red/green fragments on near-complete paragraph rewrites. Falls back to a block-level diff when the diff has more than 5 change clusters and less than half the longer text is part of a meaningfully-long unchanged run; on whole-paragraph fallback, splits the live container into two siblings (source marked removed, target marked added) so approve/reject drops the right text wholesale; sentence-level pre-pass peels identical opening or closing sentences off the diff and applies the diff only to the differing middle. Drops the redundant `$setDiffState 'modified'` calls in `HeadingDiffHandler` and `ListDiffHandler`, and adds Near-complete and Middle-sentence fixture sections to the diff ergonomics harness.
- Normalize MCP `workspaceId` for worktree callers once at the `nimbalyst-meta-agent` MCP dispatch boundary using the existing `resolveProjectPath` helper. Sessions and IPC broadcasts compare workspace ids by exact string equality against the renderer's active workspace (the repo root), so MCP-created sessions running inside a git worktree are now visible in the Kanban and Agent Sessions panels and `spawn_session` no longer fails with "Parent session not found in this workspace". Closes #157.
- Use a 420px width in `calculateCalloutPosition()` clamp math when `step.wide` is true, matching the Tailwind `w-[420px]` rendered width so wide walkthrough callouts no longer overflow the viewport edge or point past their target. Adds a `CALLOUT_WIDE_WIDTH = 420` constant and a `wide` parameter (default false) with unit coverage. Refs #148, #164.
- Fall back to all Claude session imports when the workspace-filtered scan returns nothing (e.g. Claude stored sessions under a different resolved workspace path or sibling worktree), and surface a notice when the dialog broadens scope beyond the current workspace.
- Prevent freeze from unmanaged PGLite WAL growth. PGLite runs Postgres in `--single` mode with no background checkpointer/walwriter, so WAL grew unboundedly (one user hit 263MB / 265 segments) and startup recovery blocked the single-threaded worker queue long enough that `ai:saveDraftInput` / `ai:sendMessage` tripped the 30s IPC timeout, force-quit skipped smart-shutdown checkpoint, and WAL kept growing across launches. Adds explicit `CHECKPOINT` after init and before close, periodic maintenance `CHECKPOINT` when `pg_wal` exceeds 200 MB and no query is in flight (gated on `activeOps`), raises `db.close()` timeout 2s -> 5s and `forceQuitDelay` by 3s, drops the wasted LEFT JOIN/COUNT/GROUP BY from `getAllSessionsForSync` (mapper hardcoded `messageCount: 0`), and surfaces WAL size, segment count, min/max bounds, and checkpoint timeout on the Database dashboard.
- Single-flight `refreshSession()` via a module-level inflight `Promise` and a per-`personalOrgId` keyed variant for `refreshSessionForAccount()`, so workspace cold-start no longer fires 4+ concurrent `/auth/refresh` requests (RepositoryManager init, SyncManager `getJwt`, TeamService 401 retries, TrackerSyncManager) that race for Stytch's single-use `session_token` and stall the UI for minutes. Refs NIM-430.
- Keep Claude Code stdin open across late tool permission requests by always passing a persistent `AsyncIterable` prompt via a new `PromptStreamController`, so `isSingleUserTurn` stays false and the SDK never preemptively `endsInput` on result. Ends the controller on a 5s grace timer armed on the first `result` chunk and reset on every subsequent chunk so multi-result turns (e.g. compaction) get room without deadlocking. Adds idempotent safety nets in `sendMessage`'s `finally` and `abort()`, and enriches `STREAM_CLOSED_*` diagnostics with `timeSinceResult` and controller state. Fixes #160, refs NIM-340.
- Render later-turn Codex tool calls on iOS transcripts. Stop dropping tool calls when Codex reuses per-turn item ids (`item_1`, `item_2`, ...) across turns -- dedup on `(id, toolName)` in `processDescriptor` instead of bailing in `CodexRawParser`. Route `openai-codex-acp` and `copilot-cli` through their own parsers on the mobile projection path (was falling through to `ClaudeCodeRawParser` and silently dropping every event). Enable Safari Web Inspector on iOS WKWebView under DEBUG, in both the cold-start and pre-warmed pool paths, and add gated `_debugRaw` / `_debugView` helpers on `window.nimbalyst` for inspecting the raw-to-view projection from the inspector console. Adds regression tests covering cross-turn id reuse and ACP parser routing.
- Stage deleted files in git commit proposals via `git add --all -- <paths>` so additions, modifications, and deletions are all staged for the selected pathspecs. Covers the mobile `GitCommit` response handler, the desktop `git:commit` IPC handler (widget accept path), and the `autoCommitEnabled` auto-commit path. Refs NIM-428.
- Only forward child `session:completed` events to a parent on terminal idle. Suppresses between-turn idles by checking for pending prompts in the queue, and adds a real signature dedup that resets on `session:started` / `session:streaming` so identical-state events don't replay within a turn but distinct turns aren't silenced when their final text matches. Includes `errorMessage` in the signature so distinct errors with the same `lastResponse` aren't collapsed. Stops parent updates after a child takeover (#142).
- Show platform-correct keyboard shortcuts on Windows and Linux. `getShortcutDisplay()` was platform-blind and always emitted Mac glyphs (`Cmd` to ⌘, `Shift` to ⇧, etc.) regardless of OS, and three call sites hardcoded `⌘⇧L`, `⌘⇧F`, and `⌘⇧A` as string literals. Adds an `isMac` parameter (default detected from `navigator.platform`) so the helper renders Mac glyphs only on macOS, otherwise rewrites `Cmd` to `Ctrl` and `Option` to `Alt` with familiar plus separators. Replaces the three hardcoded literals with helper calls. Closes #149.
- Avoid HEIC wasm startup for standard PNG/JPEG image attachments by lazy-loading the HEIC decoder, with a regression test for non-HEIC image compression behavior.

### Removed
<!-- Removed features go here -->

## [0.58.21] - 2026-05-04


### Added
<!-- New features go here -->

### Changed
- CI: re-enable tag-triggered electron release builds. The OSS-launch force-push that repointed old `v0.58.5..v0.58.13` tags is finished, so the temporary tags-trigger disable is lifted. Pushing a `v*` tag once again auto-fires the electron-build workflow, so future `/release` runs no longer need a separate `gh workflow run` dispatch.

### Fixed
- Pasting images into markdown documents on Windows no longer fails with a `nim-asset` 403. `ImageComponent` was splitting the document path on `/` only and dropped the document directory on Windows where paths use `\`, and the protocol validator's `normalize === input` traversal guard over-rejected the resulting mixed-separator path. `ImageComponent` now splits on both separators and the validator switches to an explicit `..`-segment check that still blocks traversal in either separator style.
- Reduce "Stream closed" tool permission errors on multi-result Claude Code turns (e.g. compaction). `ClaudeCodeProvider` now ends its persistent prompt `AsyncIterable` on a 5s grace timer that starts after the first `result` chunk and resets on every subsequent chunk, so late `can_use_tool` control requests can complete on the still-open stdin without leaving stdin open forever after idle/interrupted turns.
- Restoring from history (and any other editor-driven save) on a gitignored markdown file no longer leaves the editor showing stale content until the tab is reopened. `OptimizedWorkspaceWatcher.onChange` was skipping bypassed gitignored files on the assumption that `SessionFileWatcher` would deliver editor notifications, but `SessionFileWatcher` filters out events from `markEditorSave` (restore, manual `Cmd+S`, autosave), so neither path delivered `file-changed-on-disk` to the renderer. Fixes NIM-426.

### Removed
<!-- Removed features go here -->

## [0.58.20] - 2026-05-04


### Added
<!-- New features go here -->

### Changed
- Bump claude-agent-sdk 0.2.117 -> 0.2.126. Picks up automatic MCP server reconnection after transport-stream abort and SessionStore.append() retry logic from 0.2.119, plus the `origin` field on result messages from 0.2.126. Override pin and both workspace dependency ranges bumped in lockstep.

### Fixed
- Render local images after the webSecurity hardening from 0.58.19. Restoring `webSecurity: true` broke every renderer surface that loaded local images via `<img src="file://...">` — markdown image paste, agent transcript attachments, mockup screenshots, and the `display_visual` widget kept emitting file:// URLs and silently failed to load. Adds a runtime-side `localAssetUrl` helper that the Electron renderer registers with `nimAssetUrl` at startup so all runtime image surfaces route absolute filesystem paths through the same-origin `nim-asset://` URL the main window can actually load. Non-Electron consumers fall back to file://. Adds an E2E regression test that pastes an SVG into a doc and asserts the rendered `<img>` resolves to a `nim-asset://` URL with naturalWidth > 0. Fixes #146.

### Removed
<!-- Removed features go here -->

## [0.58.19] - 2026-05-04


### Fixed
- Harden Electron security: require a per-launch bearer token on the five internal MCP HTTP servers so a page in the user's browser can no longer fire side-effecting tool calls at the localhost ports. Drop `Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *` from MCP preflight responses (the `/clip` web-clipper endpoint keeps its CORS-open shape). Restore `webSecurity: true` on the main BrowserWindow by routing image-rendering call sites through a registered `nim-asset://` custom protocol that validates paths against an allowlist of open workspaces. Fixes #146.
- Fix invisible git log resize handle in the git extension.

## [0.58.18] - 2026-05-03


### Added
- Live-update kanban peek transcript while session is running so the AI transcript streams in real time without waiting for the turn to complete.
- Clear button on session history search input for quick filter resets.
- CollabV3 sync metrics dashboard for monitoring sync health and performance.

### Changed
- Update lodash-es for CVE fix.
- Reduce collabv3 observability sampling to 5%.
- Require workspacePath for Claude Code path loader, tightening the contract so workspace-scoped overrides resolve correctly.

### Fixed
- Route built-in editor saves through Layer D and sync diff resolution across sibling tabs so edits in one tab no longer silently overwrite concurrent changes in another.
- Smooth iOS session back navigation so the transition no longer stutters.
- Keep iOS transcript live during AI turns instead of freezing until the turn completes.
- Add settings shortcut to voice mode errors so users can quickly configure their provider when voice fails.
- Prevent autosave from overwriting AI-recreated deleted files by checking the recently-deleted set before writing.
- Use getTime() for TIMESTAMPTZ store timestamps so date comparisons work correctly across timezones (#140).

## [0.58.17] - 2026-05-01


### Added
- Auto-name Claude Code sessions via an SDK side-question on the first turn. Sessions previously relied on the agent voluntarily calling `update_session_meta` (~80% compliance), so many ended up with the user's raw prompt as the title and no phase/tags, missing from the kanban board. During `handleSystemInit`, two SDK control requests fire in parallel against the live `Query`: a server-side fast `generateSessionTitle` (~1s) that always sets the title, and an `askSideQuestion` `/btw`-style ask for `tag1,tag2|phase` parsed and persisted ourselves. A default `phase: "planning"` fallback runs after both settle so the session always lands on the kanban even if the side-question races SDK stdin closure on instant turns. Provider emits `session:title-updated` when persisting; the electron-side `MessageStreamingHandler` broadcasts that as IPC so the session list updates in real time without waiting for end-of-turn. Prompt block tells the agent the title is auto-assigned and asks it to set tags+phase early so the agent's own `update_session_meta` call can layer in additional context.
- Expose `xhigh` effort level option in the Effort Level selector. The selector previously exposed only four options (low, medium, high, max), but the underlying Claude Code CLI's `/effort` slider supports five (low, medium, high, xhigh, max). The level is forwarded unchanged via the `CLAUDE_CODE_EFFORT_LEVEL` env var. (#133, closes #132)

### Changed
- Rename the `spawn_sibling` MCP tool to `spawn_session` and add an `isolated: boolean` parameter. Sibling mode (default) still groups the new session into the caller's workstream so files-edited, tabs, and `get_workstream_overview` are shared. Isolated mode (`isolated: true`) creates a top-level session with no parent and no workstream container — use this when the new session should fix-and-commit work independently without polluting the caller's workstream. The `/launch-new-session` slash command now picks between modes based on the user's phrasing (e.g. "isolated bugs", "fix and commit separately" trigger isolated mode). `isolated` and `useWorktree` are independent: `isolated` alone keeps the same working directory; combine with `useWorktree=true` for a fully separate branch.
- Consolidate AI provider override normalization (follow-up to #128). The two near-identical `normalize` implementations (`normalizeAIProviderOverrides` in `store.ts` and `normalizeProjectOverrides` in `AIService.ts`) had diverged: only the `AIService.ts` copy stripped an own-but-undefined `customClaudeCodePath` from the input, and only it dropped an empty codex provider entry when other override keys were present. Export the `store.ts` version with both behaviors and have `AIService.ts` call it.
- Quiet noisy release-path logging: comment out routine Electron startup and document-service traces; reduce renderer workflow logs while preserving error reporting.

### Fixed
- Pass paste attachments through to OpenCode. OpenCode received only the user's text and ignored attachments, so a pasted text/image showed up as a phantom `@filename` and the agent fruitlessly searched the workspace for it. Inlines document attachments as a second text part wrapped with the filename, and emits images/PDFs as `FilePart` entries with base64 data URLs so the model actually receives the content. Fixes #121.
- Bound Codex ACP stderr buffer to prevent main-process OOM crash. The Codex ACP stderr handler accumulated every chunk into an unbounded `Buffer[]` for the entire lifetime of the child process, leaking hundreds of MB over multi-hour sessions and crashing the Electron main process with a V8 fatal abort. Replaces with a 64KB rolling tail so the exit-reason message still includes recent stderr context. Adds a small pure helper, `appendBoundedTail`, with unit tests covering edge cases and a soak that confirms boundedness over 100k appends. Fixes #119.
- Eliminate 15s waits on git status reads. `git:status` and `git:working-changes` were serialized through `gitOperationLock` because simple-git's `git.status()` refreshes the index and takes `.git/index.lock`, racing concurrent writes. With many files in the tree the storm from a single `git:status-changed` event (per-session and per-worktree refreshes) queued up to 4 deep, producing 15-17s waits in logs. Pass `core.optionalLocks=false` to skip the index refresh so reads take no lock; drop the `gitOperationLock` wrapper from both read-only handlers (write handlers keep it).
- Refresh file tree when agent creates a gitignored folder. The sidebar shows gitignored folders that aren't in `EXCLUDED_DIRS` (e.g. `temp/`, `test-results/`, `nimbalyst-local/`), but the watcher dropped all gitignored events into the replay buffer, so the tree never refreshed when an agent's `mkdir` landed in one of those paths. Listeners can now opt into receiving `add`/`unlink` (not `change`) events for gitignored paths; the workspace-tree watcher opts in so its debounced refresh fires; `SessionFileWatcher` stays opted-out so AI tracking still ignores untracked gitignored files. Fixes #127.
- Inherit project Claude path override in worktrees. Falls back from a worktree workspace to its parent project when resolving effective Claude Code path overrides; covered with a unit regression test.
- Scope Custom Claude Installation override per workspace. The "Custom Claude Installation" field in Settings > Project > Claude Agent was persisted as a single global key (top-level `customClaudeCodePath` in `ai-settings.json`), so any value set in the Project tab leaked into the User scope and into every other project. Wires `customClaudeCodePath` into the existing override infrastructure mirroring the `defaultProvider` pattern: extends `GlobalAISettings`, `EffectiveAISettings`, `EffectiveAISettings.overrides`, and `AIProviderOverrides`, plus `mergeAISettings` so a project value overrides the global one. Makes `customClaudeCodePathLoader` workspace-aware: signature becomes `(workspacePath?: string) => string`. Makes `ClaudeCodePanel` scope-aware via new `scope` and `workspacePath` props matching the `MCPServersPanel` convention. The global top-level `customClaudeCodePath` key is preserved unchanged so existing users keep their global value with no migration; project overrides are opt-in and stored under `WorkspaceState.aiProviderOverrides`. Fixes #125. (#128)
- Collapse duplicate rows in `FilesEditedSidebar` tree. Edit/Write tools persisted workspace-relative paths to `session_files` while Bash watcher and ApplyPatch flows persisted absolute paths, so the same file appeared twice in the workstream tree. Normalizes to absolute in `SessionFileTracker.trackSingleFile` so future writes are consistent, and resolves relative paths against the session workspace when loading `session_files` so existing rows dedup correctly.

## [0.58.16] - 2026-05-01


### Added
- Agents can spawn sibling sessions via `/launch-new-session`. New `spawn_sibling` MCP tool auto-promotes the caller into a workstream so the new session shares files-edited, tabs, and workstream overview with its parent. Defaults to fire-and-forget (caller is not notified when the spawned session completes; pass `notifyOnComplete=true` to opt in). Ships `/launch-new-session` as a planning-extension slash command so the flow is available in every workspace.
- Extensions can contribute themes via `contributions.themes`. Themes register with the runtime, surface in Settings > Themes under "Extension Themes," and appear in the gutter theme popup. Allows manifest-only theme extensions (no main entry point). Falls back to dark/light when the active theme disappears (extension disabled or uninstalled) and surfaces an inline banner in the Themes panel naming the missing theme and applied fallback. Adds `origin` and `contributedBy` to `ThemeManifest` so the panel can group built-in / user / extension themes without hardcoded IDs. New `docs/EXTENSION_THEMING.md` covers manifest-only packaging, namespacing, color derivation, and fallback behaviour. Closes NIM-412.
- Import Claude Code 2.1.x sessions, surfaced in the File menu (no longer dev-mode-gated). Identifies user prompts by content shape rather than `parentUuid` so follow-up prompts (always threaded in 2.1.x) import correctly. Treats the on-disk directory listing as the source of truth and uses `sessions-index.json` only to filter sidechains, so a stale index no longer causes "No sessions found." Ingests `<sessionId>/subagents/agent-*.jsonl` into the parent session with `parent_tool_use_id` so the canonical parser routes them via the existing subagent_id pathway. Inlines `<persisted-output>` references from `<sessionId>/tool-results` so long tool outputs no longer truncate after import. Renders extended-thinking blocks via an optional `thinking` field on the assistant_message payload; no SQL CHECK-constraint migration. Captures per-turn model and richer `cache_creation`/`cache_read` token usage; prefers `aiTitle` over the legacy summary entry; captures `slug`. Renders attachment entries (`deferred_tools_delta`, `mcp_instructions`, `skill_listing`) as deterministic status system_messages. Uses `args.subagent_type` for accurate subagent `agentType`. Provider session id keeps verbatim Claude Code UUID so CLI sessions resume cleanly inside Nimbalyst. Adds `claude_code_import_dialog_opened` and `import_completed` analytics, plus fixture-based tests for the v2 format.

### Fixed
- Stop renderer freeze and OOM on long Claude Code streams: long streaming assistant turns were re-projecting and re-sorting the entire transcript on every token chunk, blocking the renderer's main thread for minutes and exhausting the JS heap (NIM-411). Extracts the live-event accumulator into a framework-free module that stores events in a per-session Map and applies in-place patches for pure text updates, falling back to a full re-projection only on structural changes. Coalesces flushes through `requestAnimationFrame` so the transcript re-renders at most once per frame regardless of token rate. Adds a regression test that streams 1000 updates over a 500-event transcript and asserts at most one atom write per simulated frame.
- `spawn_sibling` now refreshes workstream UI without a manual toggle. Emits `sessions:child-added` IPC from `MetaAgentService` when a child is created with a parent and when `resolveOrCreateWorkstream` reparents the original session under a new workstream container. Renderer listener patches `sessionChildrenAtom`, `sessionParentIdAtom`, and `workstreamStateAtom.childSessionIds` so the workstream tab strip and session-history tree reflect the new sibling immediately. Listener does not change `activeChildId` so fire-and-forget spawns do not steal focus from the parent user.
- Stop `HooklessAgentFileWatcher` warn-flood on Bash directory args: filters directories out of the bash path extractor so commands like `find /dir` or `ls /dir` no longer surface non-file candidates that later fail `readFile` with EISDIR. Demotes the "Failed to read current Bash content" log from warn to debug; with the directory filter in place the remaining cases are transient races operators can't act on. Extracts the path extractor as an exported pure function with unit tests for directory rejection, file resolution, relative-path handling, workspace boundary, and trailing-punctuation stripping.
- Reduce debug logging volume across services.

### Changed
- `@nimbalyst/extension-sdk` published as 0.1.5 to align with org rename and unblock npm Trusted Publishing. Multiple iterations were required: 0.1.2 dropped `registry-url` from `setup-node` to take the OIDC path; 0.1.3 switched CI to Node 24 to skip the npm 10 -> 11 self-upgrade that hit a broken `promise-retry` reify state; 0.1.4 re-added `--provenance` to the publish command (the actual flag that triggers the OIDC handshake in npm 11.x); 0.1.5 corrected `repository.url` and `bugs.url` to lowercase `nimbalyst` to match the renamed GitHub org so npm's provenance cross-check passes. Versions 0.1.1-0.1.4 were tagged but never landed on the registry.
- Correct iOS 1.1.0 changelog entries.

## [0.58.15] - 2026-04-30


### Added
- Full undo/redo for AI chat input. Cmd+Z / Cmd+Shift+Z restore the AI input's complete state -- text, attachments, and cursor -- not just whatever the controlled textarea's broken native undo happened to capture. Covers image pastes, large-text pastes, file/session drag-drops, typeahead mention insertions, attachment removals, convert-to-text, force-paste, and ArrowUp/Down prompt history navigation. Typing coalesces into a single undo entry per burst; submit clears the stack so sent messages are immutable. New per-session `aiInputHistoryAtom` family with reducer-style pure helpers, `useAIInputUndo` hook, and in-flight `attachment:save` IPCs that resolve after an undo are dropped. IME composition commits one boundary snapshot on `compositionend`.
- Diff peek in AgentMode Files Edited sidebar: hover-revealed peek icon on FileEditsSidebar rows opens an inline unified-diff popover anchored to the row. Reuses `useDiffPeek` hook (extracted from `GitCommitConfirmationWidget`) and shares the persisted popover size with the git extension via the existing `diffPeekSize` atom.
- File history dialog works in agent mode: Cmd+Y opens history for the active file in agent mode. Replaces the `onViewHistory` prop chain with a global `historyDialogFileAtom`; `HistoryDialog` mounts once globally and restore writes to disk so the file watcher reloads editors. Wires `UnifiedEditorHeaderBar`, TabBar context menu, and file-tree context menu directly to the atom.
- Surface archived sessions in `list_recent_sessions` MCP tool: new `includeArchived` parameter (default false), forwarded to `AISessionsRepository.list/search`. Archived sessions are marked with `[ARCHIVED]` in output. Resolves NIM-932.
- `/social-response` slash command for drafting copy-paste-ready replies to user messages from Discord, GitHub, Twitter, etc. Approved replies append to `nimbalyst-local/social/social-response.jsonl` so future invocations can calibrate tone.

### Changed
- Onboarding telemetry: replace the PostHog survey with a custom `onboarding_completed` event carrying the same role/referral data. Use raw enum values (`developer`, `product_manager`, `ai`, `social`, ...) on both event and person properties so existing Devs / PMs / `role_other` cohorts keep matching. Fix `user_role` person property bug where custom "Other" text was overwriting the enum and breaking cohort filters; custom text now goes in a separate `custom_role_text` property. Split prefixed referral values (`ai:Claude`, `social:LinkedIn`, ...) into raw category + `referral_*_detail` fields.
- Coalesce streaming `assistant_message` chunks in the transcript writer: Codex-ACP and similar streaming providers were persisting one canonical assistant_message per streaming token (1694 events for one recent session), so the kanban peek's last-N-events query only surfaced a handful of trailing tokens. `TranscriptWriter.appendAssistantMessage` now extends the prior assistant_message row when mode and subagent match, with cross-batch lookup so per-chunk `processNewMessages` calls still merge. Bump kanban peek tail to 100 events so legacy bloated sessions still show meaningful context. Adds `updateEventText` to `ITranscriptEventStore` plus PGLite, in-memory, and mock implementations.
- Bump `@nimbalyst/extension-sdk` to 0.1.1 and switch publish to npm Trusted Publishing (OIDC); upgrades npm to >=11.5.1 in CI so OIDC exchange is supported. 0.1.0 was claimed via manual publish to register the package name; 0.1.1 is the first release through the trusted-publisher pipeline.
- CI: bump Node to 22 across `ci`, `electron-build`, `ios-transcript-tests`, and `publish-extension-sdk` workflows to satisfy engine requirements of `@electron/rebuild`, `node-abi`, and `chevrotain`. Raise the "nested lists with many items" diff coverage test timeout to 20s, matching adjacent large-input tests, since the LCS-based `diffWords` implementation runs near the default 5s limit under CI.

### Fixed
- Keep AI diffs granular and recover from in-flight edit races: replaces the home-grown prefix/suffix word diff with LCS-based `diffWordsWithSpace` so bullets whose bold prefix and trailing text both change show only the changed spans, not the whole line. Collapses remove+add pairs separated by a single equal-whitespace token into one change group so word-by-word LCS splits within a phrase stay one click to accept/reject. Pure-formatting changes mark only the re-formatted span as remove+add; equal-format runs stay plain so bolding one word in a long bullet no longer flashes the entire line red+green. Queues a second AI edit that arrives during an in-flight diff apply so it is not dropped by the `tagId`-only duplicate guard, with a content-hash check on the pending diff state and a regression test. Drives the file-watcher diff path with the typed `history.createTag` helper in `incrementalBaseline`. Gates diff-pipeline tracing behind a runtime `debugFlags.diffTrace` flag with an Advanced settings toggle, replacing always-on `console.log` calls in DiffPlugin and TabEditor. Adds 18 visual diff e2e tests and updates DiffPlugin unit tests to reflect the more accurate granular diff output.
- Show row add/remove and in-cell content diffs in tables: aligns table rows with LCS plus 50%-similarity pairing so an unchanged row count with a swapped row renders as a removed + added pair instead of disappearing as silent cell mods. Renders modified cells with the original content as a removed paragraph followed by the new content as an added paragraph so both old and new are visible at once, replacing the previous silent overwrite that left only the new value. Walks the table interior on approve/reject to strip the right side so partial accepts and rejects produce the expected markdown. Adds a Diff Ergonomics test harness (Developer menu) for exercising the diff approval UI without an AI session. Repairs the diff e2e suite (correct workspacePath arg to `history:create-tag`, joined diff-add marker queries, accept-before-save in empty-document edge case).
- Custom editors load for 3+ segment compound extensions: extensions registering patterns like `*.reddit.watch.json` were falling back to Monaco because the lookup only walked back one dot, finding `.json` and `.watch.json` but never `.reddit.watch.json`. Replaces the fixed-depth walks with a longest-suffix match against all registered keys. Fixes NIM-396.
- Resolve workspace-relative paths in `workspace:open-file` IPC: was forwarding the path directly to `open-document` without resolving it against `workspacePath`, causing "File does not exist" errors when callers (e.g. the git diff peek "Open in editor" link) passed git-relative paths.
- Track every file in a Codex ACP multi-file `apply_patch`: now iterates `args.changes` (path-keyed object) when `toolName` is `ApplyPatch`; previously only the first location made it into `session_files`.
- Stop context menus from flashing before positioning: pass virtual click anchors into menus before first paint, remove post-render reference attachment from shared menus.
- Session context menu positioning and visibility: attach floating menu references before first paint so menus stop briefly rendering at 0,0.
- Render OpenAI Codex icon for ACP transport in pickers: map `openai-codex-acp` to the existing `openai-codex` icon so ACP shows the same provider mark as the SDK transport.
- Render provider icons correctly in diff headers: route diff header session badges through the shared provider icon to avoid rendering raw provider ids like `OpenAI Codex ACP` as text.
- Show child transcript in workstream/worktree kanban peek: workstream/worktree cards have no transcript of their own, so the peek rendered "No messages yet" even when child sessions had activity. Resolves the effective tail-source session at peek time -- for non-leaf cards, picks the child with the most recent `updatedAt`. Cache and `RichTranscriptView` are keyed by the resolved id so invalidation and scroll state track the actual session being shown.
- Refresh kanban transcript peek when session has new events: the peek's `tailMessageCache` never invalidated, so once a session was hovered the peek kept showing that snapshot even after the session produced more turns. Always refetches tail messages on hover (cache only seeds the initial paint) and invalidates the cache entry whenever a `transcript:event` arrives for that session.
- Update opencode installation command to use `opencode-ai`.
- Reduce debug logging volume in DocumentSync.

### Removed
- Dead `DiffApprovalBar` plugin and component files: superseded by `UnifiedDiffHeader` plus the `useLexicalDiffState` hook. Only `useLexicalDiffState` in the same directory remains in use.

## [0.58.14] - 2026-04-29


### Added
<!-- New features go here -->

### Changed
- Final Stravu -> Nimbalyst rename ahead of OSS launch: rename `StravuEditor` component, `viteStravuPlugin`, and the `.stravu-editor` CSS class (~250 selectors), drop legacy `@stravu/runtime` path-alias compat shims, dedupe remaining `@nimbalyst/runtime` aliases. GitHub publish target and dev paths align to `nimbalyst/nimbalyst` (collapses prior `nimbalyst-code/nimbalyst` dual-repo split). Renames localStorage keys, the `~/Library/Logs` path, and the bin path; converts absolute markdown links to relative paths. iOS crypto test fixtures left as-is (encryption vectors are computed against the literal old path).
- OSS prep: import public-repo assets and merge launch README (issue/PR templates, marketing hero images, telemetry section, dual-license note); add community health files (CONTRIBUTING.md, CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md, SECURITY.md); declare AGPL-3.0-only on `@nimbalyst/collabv3`; move marketing images to `.github/assets/`; point CI at the public repo and drop the obsolete `publish-public` workflow; gitignore generated outputs (marketing screenshots/videos, e2e permissions screenshots, Android Room schemas, wrangler local state) and root scratch dirs; stop tracking root-level working docs and old plan files; document stable vs alpha update channel in README.
- Make GitHub Release promotion opt-in: tag pushes now build and upload to the R2 alpha channel only; creating a public GitHub Release requires explicitly running `electron-build.yml` with `create_github_release=true`. Releases are created as drafts so they require an explicit Publish click before becoming visible. Pass `--publish never` to electron-builder on every platform so the build step never creates a Release on its own.
- Loud warning in extension SDK manifest reference: `supportsDiffMode` defaults to `false` and must be explicitly set to `true`.
- iOS: stop committing the built `transcript-dist` and `editor-dist` bundles (Xcode pre-build script regenerates them; was adding ~7.5MB of churn per Vite content-hashed rebuild).

### Fixed
- Restore inline screenshot preview in the agent transcript: the canonicalization refactor changed `tool_call.result` from a structured value to a JSON-stringified string, but `EditorScreenshotWidget` kept reading it as an array/object and silently dropped the image bytes -- the header rendered without the screenshot below it. Now parses `tool.result` via `parseToolResult()` before extracting image data, persisted-output references, and error info; regression test feeds the canonical JSON-stringified MCP image array and asserts a `data:` URL `<img>` is rendered.
- Windows update download: recover from `EPERM` (or `EBUSY`) rename on antivirus-locked installer. Antivirus often holds a transient handle on the freshly downloaded installer, causing electron-updater's temp -> final rename to fail. Mitigate by cleaning the pending dir before each download and retrying once after a short delay when the rename lock is detected.
- ScheduleWakeup runtime/Electron layering for vitest: `ClaudeCodeProvider` was importing `BrowserWindow` and Electron-only services (`SessionWakeupScheduler`, `RepositoryManager`) directly. Loading those modules in vitest's Node environment triggered electron-log to call `app.getPath()` with no app context, crashing 5 provider test files. Moves wakeup row creation, scheduler call, and IPC broadcast into a static handler the Electron main process registers at startup, mirroring the existing `setEnhancedPathLoader` pattern. Runtime stays cross-platform; the feature behavior is unchanged.

### Removed
- Unused `PostHogSurvey` component (replaced by `FeedbackIntakeDialog` flow in v0.58.10; no remaining references).

<!--
NOTE: v0.58.13 was tagged but never shipped to R2 -- the release build hit a
403 (Resource not accessible by integration) at electron-builder's GitHub
publish step because CI ran on nimbalyst-code with a token that can't write
to nimbalyst/nimbalyst. The "Make GitHub Release promotion opt-in" change
above (--publish never) is the fix; v0.58.14 bundles all of v0.58.13's
intended changes plus that fix.
-->


## [0.58.12] - 2026-04-29


### Added
<!-- New features go here -->

### Changed
<!-- Changes to existing functionality go here -->

### Fixed
- Fire `ScheduleWakeup` tool calls in Claude Code sessions: the CLI emits a tool_result that looks successful but nothing in the SDK actually fires the wakeup. Intercept `ScheduleWakeup` in the `tool_use` stream and route it through `SessionWakeupScheduler` so the prompt is re-queued at fire time.
- Spawn-safe paths for codex-acp and Copilot install detection in packaged builds. `resolveCodexAcpBinary` returned a path inside `app.asar` (require.resolve in packaged Electron resolves through the asar virtual filesystem); `spawn`'s native `execve` walks the real disk, hits `app.asar` (a regular file), and fails with `ENOTDIR`. Now rewrites `app.asar` -> `app.asar.unpacked`, mirroring what the claude and codex resolvers already do. The Copilot settings panel's "is it installed?" check used the enhanced PATH (Homebrew, npm-global) while `CopilotCLIProvider.isCopilotInstalled` used bare PATH, so a packaged macOS app launched from Finder/Dock (with only `/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin`) disagreed with itself; both paths now use the same `enhancedPathLoader`.
- Cast `onerror` assignment on MCP `Server` instances to satisfy the runtime workspace's stricter tsc (ES2024 target, `exactOptionalPropertyTypes`); the inherited optional class field on `Protocol` was reachable via electron's tsc but tripped the pre-push typecheck. Affects `extensionDevServer`, `httpServer`, `metaAgentServer`, `sessionContextServer`, `sessionNamingServer`, and `superLoopProgressServer`.
- Bump runtime build heap to 8GB on the CI mac runner: the v0.58.11 Mac x64 build aborted with `FATAL ERROR: Ineffective mark-compacts near heap limit / JavaScript heap out of memory` during the runtime package's `vite build`. The electron build script already passes `--max-old-space-size=8192`; the workflow now sets the same `NODE_OPTIONS` on the runtime build step.

### Removed
<!-- Removed features go here -->

## [0.58.10] - 2026-04-28


### Added
- Recent file masks in the git Changes tab: persists a global history of up to 10 recent file masks with a dropdown next to the file mask input to pick or remove past entries. Values commit to history on blur or Enter, deduped, most-recent-first.
- Guided agent bug-report flow replaces the PostHog feedback survey: new `FeedbackIntakeDialog` with bug/feature paths and inline log-gathering consent, opened from the gutter button and a new Help > Send Feedback menu item. Picking a path spawns a Claude Code session seeded with `/nimbalyst-feedback:bug-report` or `:feature-request`, plus the user's log-consent flag. New `nimbalyst-feedback` claude-plugin (commands + skill) guides report drafting, anonymization review, and GitHub Issues posting against `nimbalyst/nimbalyst` with `bug_report.md` / `feature_request.md` templates. New MCP tools: `feedback_anonymize_text` (regex pass for paths, emails, API keys, JWTs, Stytch IDs, private IPs), `feedback_get_environment`, `feedback_open_github_issue` (falls back to title-only URL when body exceeds safe length). Help menus get Send Feedback, Browse Issues, GitHub Discussions; the PostHog survey component, registration, and CSS are removed.

### Changed
- `POSTHOG_EVENTS.md` and `FEATURE_INVENTORY.md` updated to reflect the new feedback flow.

### Fixed
- Ship `@opencode-ai/sdk` and gate every build on real packaging output validation: OpenCode sessions failed in packaged builds with "Failed to load @opencode-ai/sdk" because the SDK was never bundled into `app.asar.unpacked`. Adds `@opencode-ai/sdk` to `files` + `asarUnpack`, externalizes it in main and runtime vite configs so dynamic `import()` survives bundling. Migrates `@openai/codex-sdk` + `@openai/codex` + host-arch binary off the fragile `extraResources` pattern onto `files` + `asarUnpack`, matching the `@anthropic-ai/claude-agent-sdk` and `@zed-industries/codex-acp` siblings; cross-arch (`mac.extraResources` with `${arch}`) added so x64 Mac cross-builds still get the right binary. Extends `validate-extra-resources` to also check the codex vendored binary at `vendor/<triple>/codex/<bin>`. New `validate-packaged-sdks` resolves each dynamically-imported SDK using real ESM `import()` in an isolated temp dir whose only `node_modules` is a junction to the packaged tree, checks `import.meta.resolve` URL is inside the packaged tree, and verifies every spawnable native binary exists with execute bits. Wires `validate-packaged-sdks` into `afterPack` so it runs as part of every build (mac/win/linux) and throws on failure -- broken releases can no longer ship green.
- Use latest session title in blocked-state OS notifications: notifications for `AskUserQuestion`, `ExitPlanMode`, and `ToolPermission` showed "New Session" on the first turn instead of the real session name. The listeners closed over a local session reference loaded at the start of `sendMessage`, but `SessionManager.updateSessionTitle` creates a new session object rather than mutating the original, so `SessionNamingService` renames that happen mid-turn never reached the notification path. Now fetches the current title from the repository at notify time, matching the pattern already used for git commit notifications.
- Pass target platform/arch to the packaged-SDK validator: the `afterPack` validator was inferring the build target from `appOutDir` and silently falling back to the host arch when no arch token was present, breaking the cross-arch x64 Mac job. `afterPack` now passes `--platform`/`--arch` from electron-builder's context; the validator prefers those flags and refuses to fall back to the host arch silently.
- Install codex-acp cross-arch binary for Mac x64 builds: the cross-arch install step explicitly installed claude-agent-sdk and codex platform packages for the target arch but skipped `@zed-industries/codex-acp`, so on the arm64 runner cross-compiling the x64 Mac build, `@zed-industries/codex-acp-darwin-x64` was never on disk and `validate-packaged-sdks` correctly failed at `afterPack`. Adds `@zed-industries/codex-acp-${NPM_PLATFORM}-${TARGET_ARCH}` to the cross-arch install in `electron-build.yml` alongside the existing claude/codex installs, and a matching `mac.extraResources` entry for `@zed-industries/codex-acp-darwin-${arch}`.
- Make the packaged-SDK validator work on Windows: two Windows-specific bugs in the new validator caused every Windows x64 build to fail with all four SDK imports falsely reported as "resolved OUTSIDE packaged tree". `expectedPrefix` was hand-built as `'file://' + path.resolve(...)` which on Windows produced `file://D:\a\...` -- but `import.meta.resolve` returns `file:///D:/a/.../module.mjs`, so the `startsWith` check could never match. Use `pathToFileURL()` which produces the canonical form on every platform. Also switch `fs.symlinkSync(..., 'dir')` to `'junction'`, which works without admin/Developer Mode on Windows and is a no-op alias for `'dir'` on POSIX.

### Removed
<!-- Removed features go here -->

## [0.58.6] - 2026-04-28


### Added
- OpenCode provider gets configurable models, an LM Studio bridge, and real error surfacing: replaces the hardcoded preset stubs with a curated model list and merges in any providers/models the user has configured in `opencode.json`. The OpenCode panel writes a `provider.lmstudio` block into `~/.config/opencode/opencode.json` after discovering loaded models via `/v1/models`, so no separate Nimbalyst LM Studio toggle is required. Adds a "Disable auto-update" toggle that writes `autoupdate: false` into `opencode.json` so OpenCode does not surprise-upgrade between sessions. Picker selection now passes through to OpenCode prompt body as `{ providerID, modelID }` (previously the model field was silently ignored and OpenCode always used its config default). The real `session.error` message from OpenCode is surfaced instead of "Unknown error" by drilling into `error.data.message` first.
- Extension SDK declares app compatibility: new `nimbalyst.minAppVersion` (0.58.5) field in the SDK package so extension authors can see the minimum host version per release. Adds a compatibility table to the SDK CHANGELOG; SDK semver stays independent of the app version.

### Changed
- OSS prep: document MIT license (Nimbalyst Inc., 2024-2026) at the repo root, AGPL-3.0 for the dual-licensed `collabv3` sync server, and a new top-level `LICENSING.md` explaining the MIT vs AGPL-or-commercial dual structure. README adds a Telemetry section pointing at `docs/POSTHOG_EVENTS.md`. `TeamPanel` shows an in-app notice that Nimbalyst Teams is free during alpha and will move to a paid subscription tier in the future. Repository URL aligned to `nimbalyst/nimbalyst` so npm provenance attestations match the public repo.
- OSS prep: gitignore local-only paths and untrack `nimbalyst-local/`. Fixes the typo `nimalyst-local/` -> `nimbalyst-local/` that was why the directory had been getting committed despite the rule against it. Adds `.mcp.json`, `recovered-data/`, `recovered-data-recent/`, and `*.ipa` to `.gitignore`. Untracks 67 previously-committed files under `nimbalyst-local/` (files remain on disk, just no longer tracked). History still contains the same paths in older commits; that will be handled separately via `git-filter-repo` before the public push.
- Loud warning in `TranscriptTransformer.CURRENT_VERSION` to never bump it for parser bugfixes, since it triggers a global reparse across every provider's historical sessions.

### Fixed
- Keep AI red/green diff on open files: open files were sometimes losing the green-addition decorations when Claude Agent edited them, while deletions still rendered red (closed files were unaffected because the on-mount diff path runs against fresh state). Two races in the live path: `onFileChanged` could clobber the editor with post-edit content during the 250ms window `onDiffRequested` uses to reset the editor to `oldContent`, after which `APPLY_MARKDOWN_REPLACE_COMMAND` saw `originalMarkdown == newText` and produced no additions to mark; and the two IPC events (`history:pending-tag-created` plus `file-changed-on-disk`) both routed through diff mode, so the same tag was applied twice with overlapping reset+dispatch sequences. `TabEditor.onFileChanged` now bails when `isApplyingDiffRef` or `pendingAIEditTagRef` are set so the diff in flight wins, and `onDiffRequested` coalesces duplicate invocations for the same tag and ignores empty diffs (`oldContent === newContent`). Adds `[diff-trace]` logging across the IPC listener, `DiskBackedStore.emitChange`, `DocumentModel.handleExternalChange`, `TabEditor.onFileChanged`/`onDiffRequested`, and the `DiffPlugin` `APPLY_MARKDOWN_REPLACE_COMMAND` handler.
- Ship the `codex-acp` native binary in packaged builds (NIM-388): Codex ACP failed in packaged builds with `spawn codex-acp ENOENT` because `@zed-industries/codex-acp` was excluded from the build entirely and `CodexACPProtocol` fell through to spawning the literal name on PATH. Adds `@zed-industries/**` to `asarUnpack` so the binary is extractable, and allows `@zed-industries/codex-acp{,-*}` in `build.files` so npm's platform-specific optionalDeps land in the package via the wildcard. Covers host-arch builds on every platform; Mac cross-arch x64 still needs a follow-up (CI cross-arch install + `extraResources` entry).

## [0.58.5] - 2026-04-28


### Added
- OpenAI Codex over ACP transport (alpha): new `openai-codex-acp` provider runs Codex via the Agent Client Protocol (`@zed-industries/codex-acp`) instead of the Codex SDK, giving Nimbalyst native pre/post file-edit hooks for accurate diff baselines and deterministic per-session attribution. New `CodexACPProtocol` speaks ACP over stdio with permission, read/write, and turn-end callbacks; MCP servers (stdio + SSE via `mcp-remote` bridge) are forwarded to the agent. `OpenAICodexACPProvider` mirrors the SDK provider's surface (models, MCP wiring, permission gate, transcript adapter) and surfaces in the model picker and Codex settings. `CodexACPRawParser` turns ACP `session/update` events into canonical transcript events; MCP arg unwrap and `locations[]` promotion let widgets and edit tracking find the file path. ApplyPatch is now recognized by `SessionFileTracker`, ACP `onBeforeFileWrite` / `onTurnFilesEdited` hooks wire to `historyManager` + `sessionFileTracker`, and `RichTranscriptView` renders apply_patch via `EditToolResultCard` by parsing `unified_diff` into per-hunk replacements. Includes mock ACP agent fixtures and protocol/parser/end-to-end tests.
- AI editing of shared collaborative documents: the right-pane chat in collab mode now sees and edits the active shared document the same way Files mode does, with edits routed through Yjs so other connected users see them live. `CollabMode` passes the active-tab path + live Lexical content to `ChatSidebar` via `getDocumentContext`. New MCP tools `readCollabDoc` and `applyCollabDocEdit` dispatch to the editor over `collab://` URIs; `applyDiff` also accepts collab URIs across the runtime, MCP, and renderer paths. `DocumentContextService` injects a collab-aware preamble and alternate editing instructions so the agent uses the collab tools instead of filesystem Edit/Write. `CollaborativeTabEditor` now wraps `MarkdownEditor` in `DocumentPathProvider` so `AIChatIntegrationPlugin` registers the Lexical editor under the collab URI, and renders `LexicalDiffHeaderAdapter` so the accept/reject bar appears for pending AI edits. Normalizes `newMarkdown` whitespace before parsing the TARGET editor in `applyMarkdownReplace`, stopping the empty-paragraph drift that was visibly compounding at the top of collab docs on every edit.
- Diff peek in the git commit proposal widget: per-file diff peek popover on `GitCommitConfirmationWidget`, reusing the same component as the git extension's changes panel. `DiffPeekPopover` and `UnifiedDiffView` are shared via runtime so both surfaces render the same UI. The popover is user-resizable; size persists globally via AI settings so the proposal widget and git extension stay in sync. Adds a `working` group to `git:file-diff` for combined HEAD-vs-working diffs (handles staged + unstaged + untracked uniformly) and exposes `gitFileDiff` and `diffPeekSize` on `InteractiveWidgetHost` so the runtime widget stays platform-neutral (mobile no-ops).
- Self-pacing session wakeups via `schedule_wakeup` MCP tool: lets agents pace their own work over time, equivalent to Claude Code's `ScheduleWakeup`. Wakeups persist across app restarts but only fire while Nimbalyst is running. New `ai_session_wakeups` table (TIMESTAMPTZ `fire_at`, partial pending index) with replace-on-create semantics per session. `SessionWakeupScheduler` does single-timer arming, marks overdue rows on launch, holds in `waiting_for_workspace` when the window is closed, fires an OS notification (click focuses workspace + opens session). `schedule_wakeup` tool on `sessionContextServer` accepts a 60s..7d range. New IPC channels `wakeup:list-active` / `cancel` / `run-now` and `wakeup:changed` broadcast; central renderer listener updates `sessionWakeupAtom` family. `WakeupBanner` shows in the session header (Cancel / Fire now), with a clock icon on session list rows and the overdue state surfaced in the same banner. Workspace-window-open hook re-fires `waiting_for_workspace` rows.
- Publish `@nimbalyst/extension-sdk` to npm on tag push: new CI workflow triggers on `extension-sdk-v*` tags or manual dispatch, verifies the tag matches `package.json` version, runs the `extension-sdk:check-public` gate, and publishes with npm provenance for supply-chain attestation.

### Changed
- Consolidated tracker UI on `TrackerMode` (NIM-382): removed the duplicate `TrackerBottomPanel` and its supporting atoms, workspace state fields, and dead `PanelLayout` fields. Manual quick-add now auto-opens the detail view. `TrackerMode` is the single canonical tracker UI.
- Alpha features open to all users (NIM-380): alpha features no longer require the alpha release channel; each is opt-in per user from its natural settings panel. New Agent Features panel houses super-loops, blitz, meta-agent, Auto-approve Commits, and Developer Options. The Release Channel selector moves out of the hidden cmd-click reveal in Advanced and shows inline with the rough-developer-releases warning. Drops the central Enable-All master toggle and per-feature checkbox grid from Advanced. Voice Mode, OpenCode, and Copilot panels are now visible to everyone with an alpha badge; the collaboration toggle moves to Account & Sync. Removes the never-shipped card view mode from session history. Prunes voice-mode, opencode, copilot-cli, tracker-kanban, and card-mode from the alpha registry (each had its own enable toggle elsewhere).
- Consolidated extensions Installed view into one panel: removes the Marketplace's "Installed" tab (Discover only). All installed extensions (marketplace, GitHub, local dev, built-in) surface in Settings > Extensions with a colored source pill, enable toggle, available-update indicator, and Update / Repository / Reveal / Uninstall actions in the detail pane. Adds an "Installed (N) - M updates" link from Marketplace that navigates to the Installed panel. Replaces broken provider-toggle markup with the Tailwind `ToggleSwitch` and removes legacy CSS rules.
- Finish Tailwind migration cleanup: replaces remaining stale CSS variables (`--surface-*`, `--text-*`, `--primary-color`, `--error-color`, `--warning-color`) with `--nim-*` equivalents in `AdvancedPanel`, `VoiceModeButton`, `PendingVoiceCommand`, `TerminalPanel`, and `TranscriptSearchBar`. Drops `--primary-color` / `--primary-color-hover` backwards-compat aliases from `index.css` now that no callers remain. Removes the last `PlaygroundEditorTheme` references from `tailwind.config` comment, `NimbalystEditorTheme` JSDoc, and the e2e theme spec. Converts color/theming inline styles to Tailwind classes in `SessionKanbanBoard`, `TrackerItemDetail`, `AgentWorkstreamPanel`, `CollaborativeTabEditor`, and `SyncPanel`. Rewrites `docs/CSS_VARIABLES.md` to document the `--nim-*` system and its Tailwind class equivalents.
- Centralized renderer IPC listeners: components no longer subscribe to IPC events directly. All `window.electronAPI.on(...)` calls live in `store/listeners/*` and update Jotai atoms; components watch the atoms. Removes race conditions on session/workspace switches, kills duplicate subscriptions, and unifies debouncing. Adds 11 new central listeners (appCommands, theme, permission, sync, mcp, menuCommand, sound, notification, aiCommand, fileChange, plus matching atoms). Migrates `App.tsx`, `EditorMode`, `TabContent`, `ThemeToggleButton`, `TerminalPanel`, `TrustIndicator`, `ProjectTrustToast`, `WorkspaceSidebar`, `FileGutter`, `SyncStatusButton`, `BackgroundTaskIndicator`, `MCPServersPanel`, `NavigationDialog`, `KeyboardHandler`, `useIPCHandlers`, `useOnboarding`, `useTheme`, `index.tsx`, and `DiskBackedStore`. Deletes the dead `AgentCommandPalette` subsystem (component, agentApi, AgentService + registry/executor/schema, runtime/agents export, builtin-agents resources, toggle-agent-palette IPC, dialog wiring, useUIState plumbing) -- it was unreachable. Folds `NotificationSessionChecker` logic into `notificationListeners.ts`. Refreshes `docs/IPC_LISTENERS.md` with the four atom shapes, the "skip the initial mount" idiom, and the full listener inventory.
- Split `AIService.ts` into utils and streaming handler: `aiServiceUtils.ts` holds the pure module-level helpers (analytics bucketing, error categorization, file mention/attachment, model parsing, `safeSend`); `MessageStreamingHandler.ts` owns the 2,178-line send-message lifecycle that was previously inlined in `setupIpcHandlers`. No behavior change.
- Extracted `HooklessAgentFileWatcher` from `AIService`: the per-session file watcher misleadingly called itself "codex" even though it runs for any agent provider lacking edit-tracking hooks (codex, opencode, copilot-cli, ...). The watchers, scheduled-stop timers, `ensureForSession`/`stopForSession`/`scheduleStop` lifecycle, `trackBashEditsFromCommand`, and `advanceDiffBaseline` move into their own class. `AIService` keeps a single `hooklessWatcher` field and delegates; ~300 lines come out of the class. Adds a 100-test vitest suite for `aiServiceUtils` covering bucketers, model parsing, mention extraction, error categorization, codex error formatting, and env detection. Locks in the NIM-838 precedence rule (`resume_mismatch` and `stream_closed` beat generic auth/network).

### Fixed
- Codex ACP `apply_patch` edits now produce accurate `FilesEditedSidebar` entries and a Claude-Edit-style diff/preview in the transcript. The pre-edit baseline for `type:'add'` is forced to empty string (the ACP tool_call event arrives after Codex has already written the file, so reading disk gave the post-write content and the diff rendered as empty for new files). `session_files.metadata.operation` now derives from `args.changes[path].type` for ApplyPatch (add->create, delete->delete, else edit) so the sidebar labels new files as "Created". `EditToolResultCard`'s apply_patch extractor reads the full new-file body from `changes[path].content` and falls back to extracting `+` lines from `unified_diff` for other apply_patch flavors so `NewFilePreview` actually has content.
- `@@` session typeahead in AI input now matches the session list visuals: renders the actual provider icon (Claude, OpenAI, Codex, etc.) for each referenced session instead of a generic chat bubble; worktree-tied sessions get the worktree icon. Phase shows as a colored badge matching `SessionListItem`. Widens the popup (minWidth 360px) so it matches the visual weight of the main session list. Allows `TypeaheadOption.description` to be a `ReactElement` so the badge can render inline.
- Persist `FileGutter` collapsed state across remounts: the Referenced/Edited file lists in chat reset to expanded on every remount because the toggle was held in local `useState`. Now persisted per gutter type to workspace state, matching `diffTreeGroupByDirectory`.
- Stabilize terminal bottom-panel restore: preserves terminal screen state and cursor across reloads, avoids destructive scrollback loss and panel hydration races, and adds focused tests covering reload and reopen terminal flows.
- Remove blank space below the Claude Code Plugins panel: the plugin-content div nested its own scroll container with a hard `max-h calc` inside `settings-view-main`, which already scrolls. The cap fell short of the viewport, leaving empty space at the bottom of the panel. Drops the redundant overflow/max-height so the panel flows naturally like every other settings panel.
- Render Monaco diff gutter glyphs and match peek-style layout: adds workspace-root `node_modules` to Vite `server.fs.allow` so the Monaco codicon font loads (was 403, causing diff-insert/remove glyphs to render as tofu boxes on changed lines). Restyles the diff editor gutter to match the inline-diff-peek mockup: faint line numbers, generous spacing around `+`/`-`, green add / red remove markers, tinted gutter background. Adds E2E coverage for the Codex `file_change` diff path (encoding fidelity with non-ASCII content, Accept All persistence in the real write-then-tag ordering, NBSP round-trip).
- Unhang diff preview in `HistoryDialog` and add a Rich/Raw toggle: moves `setLoadingPreview(false)` into a `finally` block so the preview spinner clears when a snapshot loads as null/empty or its metadata can't be found, instead of hanging indefinitely. Promotes the Rich/Raw view toggle to the top header for markdown files; applies in both Diff and Full modes (Rich uses the Lexical renderer, Raw uses Monaco). Drops `bg-transparent` from base classes on toggle/option buttons across the app where it was conflicting with conditional `bg-[var(--nim-primary)]` active states, leaving white text on a light background. Affects history dialogs, search/replace toggles, tracker tabs/select, AI usage metric toggle, session dropdown, sort menu, effort/model selectors, and the AI input resize handle.
- Keep awaiting-input indicator after mode switch: the session-history "waiting for input" question mark regressed to a running spinner whenever the user navigated away from Agent mode and back, even though the AI was still blocked on the user's response. `refreshPendingPromptsAtom` only matched bare names (`AskUserQuestion`, `ToolPermission`, `ExitPlanMode`, `GitCommitProposal`), so MCP-routed `AskUserQuestion` calls (`mcp__nimbalyst-mcp__AskUserQuestion`) slipped through and overwrote the true flag with false on the next mount-time refresh. Strips the `mcp__<server>__` prefix before checking the set so both bare and MCP-prefixed forms count as pending.
- Show real third-party authors in the Claude Plugins panel: derives author from `source`/`homepage` GitHub URL when the marketplace entry has no explicit author, instead of defaulting to Anthropic. Handles the object-form `source` (`{source, url, path, ...}`) so installs for the majority of plugins no longer fall back to an empty string.

### Removed
<!-- Removed features go here -->

## [0.58.4] - 2026-04-26


### Added
- GitHub Copilot CLI as a new AI agent provider (alpha): integrates via the ACP protocol (`copilot --acp --stdio`) with session create/resume, MCP server passthrough, and streaming text/tool responses. Includes settings panel, model selector entry, provider icon, alpha feature gate, and 20 unit tests for `CopilotRawParser`.
- Inline diff peek and sessions pane in the git Changes tab: floating diff popover anchored to file rows (click pins, Space peeks, Enter promotes peek to pinned, Esc dismisses, arrows navigate) using `@floating-ui/react`. New typed `git:file-diff` IPC with separate modes for staged/unstaged/untracked/conflicted files. Right-side "Sessions that edited this file" pane lists AI sessions with per-file aggregates and provider chips; clicking opens the session in Agent mode.
- OpenCode sessions now wire through Nimbalyst's MCP tools (`AskUserQuestion`, `tracker_*`, `capture_editor_screenshot`, etc.) by registering MCP servers via `client.mcp.add` before each session and translating Nimbalyst's `{type:'sse',url,headers}` to OpenCode's `{type:'remote',url,headers}`. Tool calls now render correctly during streaming instead of after a session reload. Adds a Playwright e2e covering AskUserQuestion roundtrip plus file-edit tracking against a real OpenCode CLI.
- Recent files in the @ mention picker (NIM-263): when the AI chat input's @ typeahead opens with an empty query, surface recently viewed files from the workspace recent-files list instead of the alphabetical top-level listing. Once the user types, fuzzy search takes over. Warms the ripgrep cache in the background and falls back to the prior listing when the workspace has no recent files.
- GPT-5.5 added to OpenAI Codex and Chat model catalogs, including iOS `ModelLabel` entry for session badge display.
- Subtle "alpha" badges on alpha-bounded features: reusable `AlphaBadge` component (xs/sm rounded pill, dot for square icon buttons) with hover tooltip, applied to Voice Mode, OpenCode, GitHub Copilot, Team, Trackers, Blitz, Super Loops, Meta Agent, Card Mode, Tracker Kanban, the collab gutter button, the Team Settings menu, and any extension panel button whose manifest declares `requiredReleaseChannel: "alpha"`.

### Changed
- Redesigned Changes pane in the git panel: replaced per-file +/-/x buttons with checkboxes and group-level Stage/Unstage/Track/Discard buttons that act on the selection (or all when nothing is selected). Directory rows show tri-state checkboxes that toggle all descendants. Dropped M/A/D/? letter badges in favor of color-coded filenames using `--nim-file-*` tokens with strikethrough for deleted files. Added a glob-based File mask filter on the Changes tab toolbar that persists per-workspace via `host.storage`. Indented file/dir rows under each group header.
- System reminder cards in the AI transcript now default to collapsed; click the header to reveal the body. Plumbs `reminderKind` through the canonical transcript pipeline so the collapsed header reads "Session metadata reminder" instead of a generic label.

### Fixed
- Apply external file edits to extensions without a diff view (NIM-379): custom editors with no diff rendering (excalidraw, datamodellm, pdf-viewer, image-generation, sqlite-browser) silently dropped external file changes whenever pending AI edit tags existed. Declares `supportsDiffMode: false` on the five no-diff-view extensions, and `TabEditor`'s `onDiffRequested` handler auto-accepts the diff via `handle.resolveDiff(true)` for these editors so `newContent` flows through `DocumentModel.notifyFileChanged` and the canvas refreshes.
- Restore login widget for Claude Code auth errors (NIM-377): auth failures briefly showed the login widget from the optimistic `ai:error` path, but the reload from `ai:message-logged` replaced it with a generic error because the canonical transcript pipeline dropped the `isAuthError` flag. Threads `isAuthError` end-to-end through the raw parser, writer, and projector so `LoginRequiredWidget` renders again on reload.
- Restore PATH so Claude Code stdio MCP servers can spawn npx/uvx/docker (NIM-376): the v0.58.x cleanup that removed `setupClaudeCodeEnvironment()` left `options.env.PATH` minimal under Dock/Finder-launched Electron, breaking every npx-based MCP (posthog, figma, context7, mcp-remote, etc.) with "Executable not found in $PATH: npx". Mirrors the existing Codex/OpenCode/Copilot wiring by injecting `enhancedPathLoader` into `ClaudeCodeDeps` from the Electron main process and overlaying it onto `env.PATH` after the sanitized env is composed; teammate sub-agents pick up the same enhanced PATH via `packagedBuildOptions`. Adds `sdkOptionsBuilder.path.test.ts` covering overlay, missing-loader, and empty-string-loader fallback cases.
- Require `workspacePath` on `HistoryManager.createTag` (NIM-384): the tag creator derived `workspace_id` from `path.dirname(filePath)`, which produced the file's parent directory instead of the workspace root and tripped the `document_history` NOT NULL constraint when the model invented a root-relative path like `/foo.txt`. Threads the effective workspace path through all 8 callers (IPC, preload, `electron.d.ts`, `AgentToolHooks.tagFile`, `ClaudeCodeProvider` adapter, e2e specs).
- Preserve AskUserQuestion draft answers across unmount: user selections, "Other" toggle, and "Other" text were lost when switching AI sessions or when the transcript's virtual scroller unmounted the widget off-screen. Moves draft state into a jotai `atomFamily` keyed by `providerToolCallId` and clears the draft after submit/cancel.
- Stop OpenCode transcripts from duplicating text and bleeding across sessions: adds a dedicated `OpenCodeRawParser` for OpenCode's SSE event format (replacing the misappropriated `CodexRawParser`), with a strict assistant-message-id allowlist sourced from `message.updated` so user-message parts no longer leak as assistant text. Stops `OpenCodeProvider` from storing the double-encoded `{content, usedFallback}` envelope, drops the end-of-turn `fullText` write, and filters `raw_event` yields by session ID before persistence so concurrent OpenCode sessions don't pollute each other's raw log.
- Stop iOS draft sync from deleting characters during fast typing (NIM-383): a GRDB self-echo arriving in the same render pass as a keystroke saw a stale `lastLocalEditAt` (updated in an `onChange` declared after the draftInput handler) and overwrote the local input with the older debounced draft. Stamps `lastLocalEditAt` synchronously inside the TextField binding setter and adds a prefix guard that skips the overwrite when the local compose already contains the incoming draft as a prefix.
- Show Files tab and file browsing in the iPad sidebar: `SessionListView` always renders the Sessions|Files segmented control, `DocumentListView` gains an iPad init with a `selectedDocument` binding for `NavigationSplitView` selection mode, and `IPadNavigationView` routes file selection to `DocumentEditorView` in the detail pane.
- Harden iOS webview error handling: suppress benign `ResizeObserver` errors, make iOS editor and transcript error overlays copyable and dismissible, and skip transcript webview warmup on iPad to avoid launch hangs.
- Give every tracker type consistent tag support (NIM-370): the registry now auto-injects a standard tags field and role unless a type opts out via `supportsTags: false`, so bugs, tasks, ideas, features, and project YAMLs get the same tag experience as plans. Respects schemas that already map tags to a custom field name.
- Require custom editors to opt in to diff mode: stops `TabEditor` from assuming custom editors support AI diff and updates the SDK docs to make `supportsDiffMode` explicit opt-in.
- Stop over-counting `update_toast_shown` analytics events: the event was firing on every electron-updater `update-available` callback in main, which re-fires hourly even when the toast is suppressed (24h reminder dismissal, already-active state, etc), producing ~14x more events than actual displays. Fires the event from the renderer's `updateListeners` after all suppression checks pass and skips refires while the same version is already displayed; adds `analytics:update-toast-shown` IPC channel.
- Fix iOS CI failures from `@vscode/ripgrep` 403 rate limit by passing `--ignore-scripts` to `npm ci` for the transcript Vite build (same root cause as the v0.57.36 electron-build fix).

### Removed
<!-- Removed features go here -->

## [0.58.3] - 2026-04-23


### Added
<!-- New features go here -->

### Changed
<!-- Changes to existing functionality go here -->

### Fixed
- Always pre-resolve the Claude Code binary path in packaged builds: the v0.58.2 "let SDK resolve" experiment (Workaround A for NIM-838) caused the SDK's `require.resolve` to return a path inside `app.asar` instead of `app.asar.unpacked`, producing `spawn ENOTDIR`. The SDK then silently fell back to the user's standalone Claude Code CLI, which ignores `--resume` and broke multi-turn sessions. Remove the `skipPreResolve` gate -- all platforms now pre-resolve via `resolveClaudeAgentCliPath()`, which correctly rewrites `app.asar` to `app.asar.unpacked`.
- Ignore transient hook session IDs that caused false resume mismatch (NIM-838 root cause): SessionStart hooks (`hook_started`, `hook_response`) emit a transient pre-resume UUID before the init frame arrives with the real session ID. `parseSystemChunk` captured `session_id` from all system chunks, so the resume-mismatch guard aborted on the hook UUID before the init frame ever arrived. Only emit `session_id` from system chunks with `subtype: "init"`; hook frames are now ignored for session ID capture.
- Hot-reload `customClaudeCodePath` without app restart: the custom Claude Code binary path was previously read once at startup and cached as a static string, so changing it in Settings had no effect until restart. Replace the static string with a loader function that reads fresh from the electron-store on each `sendMessage` call, and remove the redundant `setCustomClaudeCodePath` call from the save handler since the loader reads from the same store the save writes to. Follows the same lazy-loader pattern used by `mcpConfigLoader`, `claudeCodeSettingsLoader`, etc.
- Prevent duplicate transcript events from concurrent `ensureUpToDate` calls: concurrent `ensureUpToDate`/`processNewMessages` calls could race on the same watermark and write duplicate canonical events. Add a per-session promise-chain lock to `TranscriptTransformer` so calls serialize instead. Also log the effective binary path on each `buildSdkOptions` call to confirm `customClaudeCodePath` changes take effect without restart.
- Suppress result chunk text in resume batches to prevent duplicate assistant messages: the SDK's result chunk always echoes assistant text. When the assistant and result chunks land in separate transformer batches (observed 68ms apart, split by a throttled `ensureUpToDate`), the fresh parser's `processedTextMessageIds` is empty and the result text passes the guard. Add `suppressResultChunkText` flag to `ClaudeCodeRawParser`, set by the transformer on resume batches (`afterId > 0`) where prior batches already handled any assistant text. Slash-command-only turns still work because they're processed in the first batch.

### Removed
- NIM-838 diagnostic instrumentation: root cause (transient hook session IDs) has been found and fixed, so remove the temporary debugging infrastructure -- `DEBUG_CLAUDE_AGENT_SDK=1` env var injection on resume turns, `logResumeDiagnostic()`/`schedulePostTurn1Diagnostic()` methods, `RESUME_DIAGNOSTIC` filesystem/stderr dumps from the mismatch guard, and restore the stderr ring buffer from 200 back to 50 lines.

## [0.58.2] - 2026-04-23


### Added
<!-- New features go here -->

### Changed
- Remove Claude Code SDK prewarm end to end: prewarm was gated behind `PREWARM_ENABLED=false` after it was found to interfere with session resume and required a `canUseTool` shim to keep tool permissions working. Remove the dead path (provider fields, `prewarm`/`discardWarmQuery` methods, `ai:prewarm` IPC handler, preload bridge, type, and renderer `useEffect`), collapsing `sendMessage` to a single `query()` call and removing the warm-query shim entirely. Does not fix NIM-838 -- prewarm was already inert -- but shrinks the surface to reason about while chasing the real resume-mismatch bug.

### Fixed
- Restore Claude Code on packaged macOS/Linux (regression from v0.58.1): v0.58.1 shipped the NIM-838 workaround that passed `pathToClaudeCodeExecutable=undefined` in packaged mode so the SDK could resolve the binary itself. On packaged macOS arm64, the SDK's `require.resolve` returns a path inside `app.asar` where the binary only exists under `app.asar.unpacked`, producing `spawn ENOTDIR` on turn 1 and breaking Claude Code entirely for Mac users. Restore pre-resolution on every platform except packaged Windows, where the original NIM-838 resume-mismatch reports originated and the experiment remains open. `TeammateManager` now receives the same pre-resolved path so teammate spawns don't hit the same failure.

## [0.58.1] - 2026-04-23


### Added
<!-- New features go here -->

### Changed
<!-- Changes to existing functionality go here -->

### Fixed
- Diagnose and work around Claude Code session resume mismatch (NIM-838): follow-up messages in Claude Code sessions fail on v0.57.33+ with "Session resume mismatch" because the native SDK binary (0.2.114+) mints a fresh `session_id` on every `--resume` attempt. Two platform-targeted workarounds plus broad diagnostic instrumentation: stop overriding `pathToClaudeCodeExecutable` in packaged mode so the SDK's own `require.resolve` picks the binary (dev mode unchanged); force `HOME=USERPROFILE` on Windows so the binary's home resolution is deterministic across turn boundaries; enable `DEBUG_CLAUDE_AGENT_SDK=1` on resume turns and bump stderr capture to a 200-line tail-biased ring buffer for the session-lookup fingerprint; `logResumeDiagnostic` walks every plausible home root from subprocess env (HOME, USERPROFILE, APPDATA, CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR, `os.homedir()`), locates the session jsonl if it exists, and dumps the head of any `.claude/debug/sdk-*.txt` the SDK wrote, firing at preQuery, postMismatch, and +500ms/+2000ms post-turn-1 so we can separate "turn 1 never wrote" from "turn 2 reads elsewhere"; `ai_stream_interrupted` now carries `errorCategory` and `ai_request_failed.errorType` gains the same buckets so `resume_mismatch` and `stream_closed` can be split from the generic error bucket in PostHog. Full evidence chain, bare-SDK repro results, and alpha-build readiness checklist in `nimbalyst-local/plans/claude-code-resume-mismatch-investigation.md`.

## [0.58.0] - 2026-04-22


### Added
<!-- New features go here -->

### Changed
<!-- Changes to existing functionality go here -->

### Fixed
- Stop tracker items leaking across open projects (NIM-346): MCP tracker change broadcasts went to every BrowserWindow, so items created in one project transiently showed up in other open projects' tracker lists. Scope MCP broadcasts via `findWindowByWorkspace` so events only reach the owning workspace's window, and add a defensive workspace filter in the renderer listener so stray cross-project events are dropped before they touch the atom map.
- Stop buggy tracker widget from white-screening the app (NIM-351): a malformed tracker result with non-array `tags` threw during `CreatedView`/`RetrievedView` render and unmounted the transcript. Guard both views against non-array `item.tags`, coerce `args.tags` to an array in `tracker_create`/`tracker_update` so bad shapes from the agent aren't persisted going forward, wrap custom tool widgets in `ToolWidgetErrorBoundary` so a crashing widget renders an inline fallback instead of bringing down the transcript, and wrap the renderer root in `ErrorBoundary` as a safety net so escaped errors show a recoverable screen instead of a white screen.
- Avoid `document-service` IPC calls outside workspace windows: gate tracker sync startup on workspace-backed window state and prevent non-workspace windows (settings, help, etc.) from invoking `document-service` handlers, which produced errors and log spam when those windows were open.
- Ship working `node-pty` in the Linux AppImage (NIM-354): the Linux AppImage crashed on launch because packaged `node_modules/node-pty` contained no loadable `pty.node` for `linux-x64` -- the upstream `node-pty@1.x` npm package ships prebuilds for darwin and win32 only, and electron-builder's `install-app-deps` runs `@electron/rebuild` with `buildFromSource=false` so the Linux job silently skipped rebuilding instead of falling back to node-gyp. Add a Linux-only CI step that runs `@electron/rebuild --force` against the target Electron version and verifies `build/Release/pty.node` actually landed, and extend `validate-extra-resources.js` with a `node-pty` binary check that fails the build when no `pty.node` exists for the current target (mirroring the existing ripgrep and claude-agent-sdk checks). Catches this class of silent-skip on any platform, not just Linux.
- Remove console error when dropping a session onto itself: the drop is already a no-op but logged a noisy console error on every self-drop; now returns early without logging.

### Removed

## [0.57.42] - 2026-04-22


### Added

- Render custom tool widgets in Codex sessions: Codex reuses short per-turn item IDs (`item_1`, `item_2`, ...) across sessions, so the transcript transformer's `findByProviderToolCallId` queried globally and deduped a new session's `tool_call` against a same-named tool from a previous session, dropping the canonical event and hiding widgets like the git commit proposal. Scope the lookup to the current session by threading `sessionId` through the store interface, `processDescriptor`, the `ParseContext` wiring in `TranscriptTransformer` and `projectRawMessages`, and the `ToolCallMatcher` diff lookups. Adds a regression test covering two sessions that both call `mcp__nimbalyst-mcp__developer_git_commit_proposal` with `item_1`. Refs NIM-342.
- Detect Windows Claude Code installs correctly: the detector only looked for `claude.exe`/`claude` on PATH and missed the npm-installed `claude.cmd` shim, so users with a working Claude Code install still saw the false "Claude Code not detected" setup warning. Recognize `claude.cmd` and add regression coverage for the Windows installation check alongside the related app-startup change.
- Ship ripgrep on Windows ARM64 and the Claude Agent SDK native binary on Intel Mac: two silent `extraResources` failures caused broken release builds (ripgrep missing from Windows ARM64 installs with `spawn rg ENOENT`, and the `claude-agent-sdk` native binary missing from Intel Mac installs). Re-run `@vscode/ripgrep` postinstall explicitly after `npm ci --ignore-scripts` on `windows-11-arm` (the `--ignore-scripts` flag, added to dodge workerd's missing ARM64 prebuild, also skipped the rg.exe download); extend `validate-extra-resources` to walk `build.{mac,win,linux}.extraResources`, expand the `${arch}` macro via `BUILD_ARCH`, and assert the actual binary exists inside `@vscode/ripgrep/bin` and `@anthropic-ai/claude-agent-sdk-<platform>-<arch>`; extend `normalize-extra-resources` to handle platform-specific entries and self-heal npm hoisting in both directions; wire `validate:extra-resources` into `build:win` scripts (was only running for mac/linux).
- Restore Electron typecheck for Windows Claude detection: remove the explicit `shell` option from the new Windows Claude version checks so the Electron package compiles cleanly again.
- Scope `validate-extra-resources` to the current build platform: the v0.57.40 validator walked every `build.{mac,win,linux}.extraResources` block on every runner, so the Linux release job failed validation on `@anthropic-ai/claude-agent-sdk-darwin-x64` -- a package that isn't installed on a Linux runner and isn't needed for the Linux build output. Limit platform-scoped walking to entries whose macro matches `process.platform` (with a `BUILD_PLATFORM` override for future cross-platform scenarios); top-level `extraResources` still validate everywhere. Root cause of v0.57.40 failing to ship.
- Combine cross-arch native binary installs into a single `npm install` invocation: v0.57.41's Intel Mac build ran two sequential `npm install --no-save --force` calls (one for `@anthropic-ai/claude-agent-sdk-darwin-x64`, then one for `@openai/codex-darwin-x64`). Because neither package is recorded in `package.json`, npm treated the SDK binary as extraneous on the second invocation and pruned it -- the Codex install logged `added 1 package, removed 1 package`, leaving only Codex on disk and tripping the new extraResources validator with a "missing `claude-agent-sdk-darwin-x64`" error. Pass both package specs to a single `npm install` so npm keeps both trees intact. Root cause of v0.57.41 failing to ship.

## [0.57.39] - 2026-04-22


### Changed
- Release collabv3 0.1.63.
- Increase maximum width for `TrackerMainView` component.
- Bump `claude-agent-sdk` to 0.2.117, which ships Claude Code native binary 2.1.117 (built 2026-04-21). Picked up after observing a `hook_0 "Stream closed"` cascade on 2.1.116 in a non-Unknown-tool path (plain Bash, long turn, no user-facing hook configured) -- the cascade is binary-side, so the only lever on our side is the binary version. Also aligns `packages/electron/package.json` from `^0.2.114` to `^0.2.117` so all three declarations match (previously drifted during the 0.2.116 bump). Refs NIM-340.

### Fixed
- Normalize hoisted `extraResources` before Mac packaging: the previous normalize step ran inline with validation but, on Mac cross-arch builds, the packaging invocation sidestepped the normalization and the validator still saw missing `@openai/codex-sdk` paths. Run the normalize step as a dedicated pre-step in the Electron mac build flow so symlinks are in place before `validate-extra-resources` and electron-builder start, preventing CI packaging failures when workspace dependencies are hoisted. Root cause of v0.57.38 failing to ship.
- Normalize `extraResources` paths across npm hoisting layouts: npm's workspace hoisting isn't stable across platforms -- the same lockfile can place `@openai/codex-sdk` in `packages/electron/node_modules/` on one machine and in the repo root `node_modules/` on another. The electron-builder `extraResources` entries use literal paths, so when npm hoists differently the Linux CI build failed `validate-extra-resources`. Added a pre-validate normalize step that, for any entry whose electron-local path is missing but whose root-level equivalent exists, creates a symlink at the expected location. Entries are processed shallowest-first so one symlink (e.g. `@openai`) covers any nested entries (e.g. `@openai/codex-sdk`). No-op when hoisting already matches. Root cause of v0.57.37 failing to ship.
- Restore bundled ripgrep via `@vscode/ripgrep`: the claude-agent-sdk upgrade to a native binary package stopped shipping the vendored ripgrep binary at `vendor/ripgrep/<arch>/rg`. `getRipgrepPath()` fell back to system `rg`, which most users don't have, so `findWorkspaceFiles` threw `spawn rg ENOENT`, the QuickOpen cache never built, and the `@` file-mention typeahead in AIInput had no options. Added `@vscode/ripgrep` as a direct dep (postinstall fetches the host-arch rg), rewrote `getRipgrepPath()` to resolve the binary in dev and packaged builds, bundled via `extraResources` into `app.asar.unpacked/node_modules/@vscode/ripgrep`, and extended the CI cross-arch install step to re-run postinstall with `npm_config_arch` so cross-compile jobs pack the correct binary.
- Lock `@vscode/ripgrep` in package-lock.json so CI installs the same version used to bundle rg.
- Pass `GITHUB_TOKEN` to the `@vscode/ripgrep` postinstall on CI: `@vscode/ripgrep` downloads its rg binary from `ripgrep-prebuilt` GitHub releases during postinstall. Unauthenticated CI runners hit the 403 rate limit, breaking `npm ci`. Expose `secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN` on both the initial install step and the cross-arch re-download step so the postinstall authenticates its fetch. This was the root cause of v0.57.36 failing to ship.
- Stop `hook_0 Stream closed` cascade on Claude Code 2.1.116: long agent turns hit repeated `Error in hook callback hook_0` / `Tool permission request failed: Error: Stream closed` failures as soon as the agent invoked one of the CLI's new built-in tools (`Monitor`, `ExitWorktree`, crons, etc.). The old `SDK_NATIVE_TOOLS` whitelist missed those tools, so Nimbalyst tried to execute them locally, threw `Unknown tool`, and destabilized the CLI<->host control stream for the rest of the turn -- the agent then retried blindly for minutes. Added `Monitor`, `ExitWorktree`, `PushNotification`, `RemoteTrigger`, `CronCreate/Delete/List`, `ListMcpResources(Tool)`, `ReadMcpResource(Tool)`, `Config`, `Mcp` to `SDK_NATIVE_TOOLS`; replaced the unknown-tool throw with a warn-and-skip that assumes CLI-native so future tool additions log one line instead of breaking the stream. Refs NIM-340.
- Narrow `STREAM_CLOSED_RAW_CHUNK` diagnostic to real errors: was matching any chunk whose JSON contained the string "Stream closed", firing on successful tool results that legitimately mentioned the phrase (e.g., `git log` echoing a commit message about the stream-close fix). Narrowed to only match user/tool_result chunks with `is_error=true` and "Stream closed" in the content string. Verified against archived cascades: every real stream-close event still matches; the commit-message false positive no longer does.
- Silence `TreeMatcher` guidepost error on unchanged subtrees: when a list subtree is diffed and its children have identical text, the synthetic source/target markdown blobs match exactly and `createTwoFilesPatch` returns a patch with zero hunks, which `parseUnifiedDiff` rejects as invalid. The caller already swallows the error but logged noisily. Short-circuit `buildTextBasedGuidePosts` when the blobs are identical so the diff library is never invoked in this case.

## [0.57.35] - 2026-04-22


### Fixed
- Shared/hybrid tracker types rendering blank in workspaces with no team: routed through the collaborative editor path which couldn't resolve a DocumentRoom, leaving the detail panel stuck on "No content". Now detects team membership as a tri-state (pending/no-team/team) in `TrackerItemDetail`, skips the document-sync IPC when no team exists (falls back to the local PGLite Lexical editor that already backs collab content), and holds the loading state while team detection is in flight so the editor doesn't briefly mount in the wrong mode.
- electron-store failing to load in packaged builds with `Cannot find module 'p-try'`: the allowlist-style `build.files` array was missing `p-try`, which `pkg-up`'s nested `p-limit@2.3.0` requires. Broke the project move feature. Added `p-try` to the allowlist.
- Unrelated SDK errors misreported as "session expired": the post-error fallback was using `~/.claude/history.jsonl` as authority for whether a resumed session still existed. When the lookup missed (write-timing races, programmatic sessions the SDK never logs to history), any unrelated SDK error was swapped for a "session expired" message and the session mapping deleted, forcing the user onto a fresh conversation. Demoted the check to a soft diagnostic and preserve the session mapping -- real expiry is still caught upstream via the SDK's own error signature.

## [0.57.34] - 2026-04-22


### Added
- Collaborative tracker content editing via DocumentRoom: team-synced tracker items using Yjs with review gate, awareness cursors, and PGLite persistence. TrackerItemDetail now supports three content paths (file-backed, local-pglite, collaborative); review banner shows pending remote changes with accept/reject; server auto-repairs corrupt tracker items by re-encrypting from local PGLite data when decryption fails. 1MB content size limit enforced. Configurable TTL on DocumentRoom (tracker content rooms use 90-day TTL).
- Extension marketplace update flow: auto-updates installed marketplace extensions silently on app launch, update indicators in Discover tab (cards + detail modal), per-extension Update button and Update All in Installed tab, new `/release-extension` command, bundled registry updated with mindmap v1.0.1.
- Pre-fetch commit context to eliminate agent discovery latency: new `git:get-commit-context` IPC handler cross-references session-edited files with git status before sending to the agent. `handleSmartCommit` injects the pre-fetched file list into the prompt so the agent calls `developer_git_commit_proposal` immediately. New `CommitRequestCard` widget renders commit-request user messages as a collapsible card instead of raw prompt text.
- Capture `cpu_arch` as PostHog person property so user base can be segmented by CPU architecture (arm64, x64) -- GitHub download counts lose this fidelity once pre-split generic assets are in the mix.

### Fixed
- Session resume failing in packaged builds: `setupClaudeCodeEnvironment()` was overlaying a synthetic env on top of the carefully sanitized `process.env`, clobbering it. Designed for the old Node.js execution path but the native binary doesn't need NODE_PATH/PATH rewrites -- just HOME. Removed the overlay so dev and packaged mode launch the binary with the same environment. Also: `checkSessionExists` fails open when `~/.claude/history.jsonl` is missing (fixes Windows where the CLI may store data elsewhere), stopping real SDK errors from being misdiagnosed as "session expired".
- MIME type resolution for chat attachments: `.log`, `.ts`, `.py`, `.yaml`, and other text-based files were rejected as "unsupported file type" because browsers report empty or `application/octet-stream` MIME for those extensions. Added extension-to-MIME fallback map (~70 extensions), passed filename through to validation, and broadened supported document MIME list (html, xml, yaml, js, ts, etc.).
- iOS compose bar clearing dictated text after keyboard voice input: dismiss focus before clearing the text binding on send/queue so any in-flight keyboard dictation commits first. Otherwise UIKit's pending dictation buffer re-inserted text after the clear, leaving the dictated message stuck.
- Tracker content editor destroying/remounting on every save by removing `updatedAt` dependency from content load effect.
- Model picker showing raw variant ID for pinned opus-4-6 on initial load: use `CLAUDE_CODE_MODEL_LABELS` map instead of naive first-char capitalization so `opus-4-6` displays as `Opus` not `Opus-4-6`. Matches server-side label format (dot separator).
- `scheduleAIProviderPersist` re-sending stale debug settings: provider saves fetched `currentSettings` via `aiGetSettings()` and re-sent `showToolCalls`/`aiDebugLogging` alongside `apiKeys`/`providerSettings`. If a debug toggle changed while a provider save was in the 500ms debounce window, the older debug values were re-saved over the fresh ones. The `ai:saveSettings` handler guards every field with `!== undefined`, so dropping those keys preserves existing values. Last remaining holdout of the NIM-801 spread pattern.
- Dropping advanced settings when debounce timer resets: toggling Extension Dev Tools (or any `changedKeys`-driven advanced setting) silently failed to persist when another setting mutated within the 500ms debounce window. The scheduler captured `changedKeys` in a `setTimeout` closure and cleared the pending timer on each call, losing the first call's keys entirely. Accumulate `changedKeys` into a module-level Set and capture the latest settings snapshot so the flushed timer sees every queued change. Same fix applied to `scheduleDeveloperFeaturePersist`.

### Removed
- Failing mermaid import exploration test (debugging artifact with `console.log` diagnostics whose subgraph case asserted on the `mermaid-to-excalidraw` library's internal fallback for inputs it throws on; consistently failing CI with no production code relying on the assertion).

## [0.57.33] - 2026-04-21


### Added
<!-- New features go here -->

### Changed
<!-- Changes to existing functionality go here -->

### Fixed
- Intel Mac packaged build was missing the Claude Code x64 SDK binary due to three compounding issues:
  - `afterPack.js` used `packager.arch` which was falsy for some arch values, falling through to `process.arch` (arm64 on the build machine). Pruning kept the arm64 binary and deleted the x64 one. Now uses `context.arch`.
  - electron-builder's `files` patterns only include packages in the npm dependency tree. The `--no-save` cross-arch install isn't in the lock file, so `files` globs silently skipped it. Added `mac.extraResources` with the `${arch}` macro to copy the binary from root `node_modules` regardless of lock-file state.
  - Simplified the CI cross-arch install to put the binary in root `node_modules/`, where `extraResources` reads from.
- Added diagnostic logging and improved error messages when Claude Code binary resolution fails at runtime (shows which package and arch were expected).

## [0.57.32] - 2026-04-21


### Added
<!-- New features go here -->

### Changed
- Upgrade Claude Agent SDK 0.2.114 -> 0.2.116 (permission dialog crash fix, session resume perf, API 400 race condition fix) and `@anthropic-ai/sdk` 0.71.2 -> 0.81.0 (deduped with the agent SDK dependency)
- Address 36 npm audit vulnerabilities including 2 critical: upgrade `simple-git` 3.30.0 -> 3.36.0 (command execution RCE fix), `mcp-remote` 0.1.37 -> 0.1.38, plus high-severity fixes in `vite`, `rollup`, `tar`, `picomatch`, `path-to-regexp`, `@hono/node-server`, `@xmldom/xmldom`, `undici`, and others. Remaining 30 are upstream/transitive with no fix available.

### Fixed
- Cross-arch SDK install step hitting `ERR_PACKAGE_PATH_NOT_EXPORTED`: `@anthropic-ai/claude-agent-sdk` and `@openai/codex` both have an `exports` field in `package.json` that doesn't expose `./package.json`, so `require.resolve('<pkg>/package.json', { paths: [...] })` fails regardless of the `paths` option. Probe the known `node_modules` locations with bash file existence, then `require()` the absolute path -- absolute paths bypass `exports` resolution and just read the file.
- Restore typecheck after the `@types/node` bump pulled in by the npm audit fix: TypeScript 5.7+'s newer `Uint8Array<ArrayBufferLike>` / `Buffer<ArrayBufferLike>` definitions narrow `SharedArrayBuffer` out of `ArrayBuffer`, breaking ~13 `crypto.subtle.*`, `fetch`, and `new Blob()` call sites. Added `as BufferSource` / `as BodyInit` / `as BlobPart` casts at the boundaries in `ShareHandlers.ts`, `KeyRotationService.ts`, `OrgKeyService.ts`, `CollabAssetService.ts`, and the runtime sync providers (`DocumentSync.ts`, `ECDHKeyManager.ts`, `ProjectSyncProvider.ts`, `TeamSync.ts`, `TrackerSync.ts`). All heap-allocated `Uint8Array`s, so the casts are safe at runtime.
- Intel Mac "spawn ENOTDIR" reproduced after the v0.57.29 attempt: running `npm install --prefix packages/electron/` makes npm read that workspace's `package.json`, which lists `@nimbalyst/runtime` and other workspace siblings as dependencies. Without workspace context npm tries to resolve those from the public registry and 404s. Install into a temp directory that has no workspace neighbors, then copy the binary into `packages/electron/node_modules/` where electron-builder can find it.
- Tool permission prompts lost after renderer reload: `safeSend` silently dropped events when the original `webContents` was destroyed (e.g., HMR reload), so the pending permission promise never resolved and the SDK stream timed out with "Stream closed". Now falls back to any live `BrowserWindow`.
- Always include subprocess stderr in error messages: previously stderr was only appended to errors containing "exited with code", losing diagnostic context for native binary crashes producing "Stream closed" or other errors.

Remaining 30 are upstream/transitive with no fix available.

### Fixed
- Cross-arch SDK install step on CI now uses `require.resolve(..., { paths: ['./packages/electron'] })` to look up the Claude Agent SDK and Codex versions: the previous hardcoded `./packages/electron/node_modules/...` path didn't exist when npm workspaces hoisted the SDK to the root `node_modules/`, which broke the Intel Mac cross-arch install and cascaded into fail-fast cancellations for the whole matrix.
- Restore typecheck after the `@types/node` bump pulled in by the npm audit fix: TypeScript 5.7+'s newer `Uint8Array<ArrayBufferLike>` / `Buffer<ArrayBufferLike>` definitions narrow `SharedArrayBuffer` out of `ArrayBuffer`, breaking ~13 `crypto.subtle.*`, `fetch`, and `new Blob()` call sites.

All heap-allocated `Uint8Array`s, so the casts are safe at runtime.
- Intel Mac "spawn ENOTDIR" reproduced after the v0.57.29 attempt: running `npm install --prefix packages/electron/` makes npm read that workspace's `package.json`, which lists `@nimbalyst/runtime` and other workspace siblings as dependencies. Without workspace context npm tries to resolve those from the public registry and 404s, aborting the install before any native binary lands on disk. Install into a temp directory that has no workspace neighbors, then copy the binary into `packages/electron/node_modules/` where electron-builder can find it. Same pattern for the Codex binary.
- Tool permission prompts lost after renderer reload: `safeSend` silently dropped events when the original `webContents` was destroyed (e.g., HMR reload), so the pending permission promise never resolved and the SDK stream timed out with "Stream closed". Now falls back to any live `BrowserWindow` so the permission UI still appears after a renderer reload.
- Always include subprocess stderr in error messages: previously stderr was only appended to errors containing "exited with code", so native binary crashes producing "Stream closed" or other errors had their stderr silently dropped, losing diagnostic context needed to debug intermittent binary deaths.

- Intel Mac "spawn ENOTDIR" still reproduced after v0.57.28: npm workspaces hoist packages to the root `node_modules/` even when `npm install` is run from a child directory, so the darwin-x64 SDK binaries kept landing where electron-builder couldn't find them.

### Changed
- Gate SDK prewarm behind `PREWARM_ENABLED=false` temporarily while the session resume and canUseTool plumbing bakes

### Fixed
- Intel Mac "spawn ENOTDIR" on launch: run the cross-arch npm install from `packages/electron/` (not the monorepo root) so the darwin-x64 Claude Agent SDK and Codex binaries land in `packages/electron/node_modules/` where electron-builder's `files` patterns can resolve them. Keeps `macos-latest` as the runner since GitHub is phasing out Intel runners.
- Session resume silently starting fresh conversations after a Nimbalyst restart: `ai:prewarm` cached the Claude Code provider without calling `setProviderSessionData`, so `sessions.getSessionId()` returned undefined and the SDK spawned a brand-new session with no visible error. `setProviderSessionData` now runs on every `sendMessage`, the prewarm IPC handler also restores session data, and the restore is asserted against the DB. The stream now compares the SDK-reported `session_id` against `options.resume` for Claude Code, Codex threads, and managed teammates, throwing on mismatch so silent resume failures surface loudly.
- canUseTool Zod errors on every tool call after prewarm: the prewarm stub returned `true`, which spread into `{toolUseID: ...}` with no `behavior`/`updatedInput`/`message` and failed the CLI's Zod schema. Replaced with a delegating shim backed by `warmCanUseToolRef`; the real session-bound handler is installed before the warm query is reused.

### Changed
- Gate SDK prewarm behind `PREWARM_ENABLED=false` temporarily while the session resume and canUseTool plumbing bakes

### Fixed
- Mac x64 build switched to a native macos-13 Intel runner instead of cross-compiling on ARM64: SDK native binaries were landing in root `node_modules/` where electron-builder couldn't find them, causing "spawn ENOTDIR" on Intel Macs. The cross-arch install step is no longer needed.

### Changed
- Opt GitHub Actions workflows into the Node.js 24 runtime (FORCE_JAVASCRIPT_ACTIONS_TO_NODE24=true) to silence deprecation warnings ahead of the forced default in June 2026

### Fixed
- Use `npm install --force` for the cross-arch native binary step so npm accepts platform-specific optional dependencies on the arm64 CI runner (was failing the CPU check and blocking the Intel Mac build fix from actually shipping)
- Intel Mac builds now ship with the correct native binaries: CI installs target-arch Claude Agent SDK and OpenAI Codex packages when cross-compiling macOS x64 on an arm64 runner, resolving "CLI not found" errors
- Windows agent mode input is focusable on the first session: guard auto-focus with an offsetParent visibility check and use IntersectionObserver to retry when the panel becomes visible
- Windows auto-update relaunches the app after silent install (flip NSIS runAfterFinish to true) so the update flow matches macOS
- Race condition in ElectronDocumentService where refreshWorkspaceData didn't set initializationPromise, letting listDocumentMetadata start a competing background scan that blocked subsequent refreshes via the isScanning guard
- Remove stale ELECTRON_RUN_AS_NODE assertion in the claudeCodeEnvironment test (env var was intentionally removed during the native binary SDK upgrade)
