# Changelog

All notable changes to Nimbalyst will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).


## [Unreleased]

### Added
<!-- New features go here -->
- Tracker types can now be organized into manually ordered folders that stay in sync for everyone on a Nimbalyst Team project.
- The Agent navigation icon now shows sessions awaiting input, running, or unread and opens a grouped attention list with a mark-all-read action.

### Changed
<!-- Changes to existing functionality go here -->
- Completed tracker reference chips now show a checkmark and crossed-out text in documents and AI chats.
- Mobile session sync now skips messages the mobile transcript never displays, cutting sync storage and traffic.

### Fixed
- PR mode now explains when a merge needs the GitHub CLI `workflow` scope and offers the recovery command instead of showing `gh api -X failed`.
- Importing Mermaid diagrams into Excalidraw works again: flowcharts (including subgraphs) become editable shapes instead of failing or degrading to a broken image, and AI-added arrows no longer lose their labels.
- Voice mode no longer stops listening while you are still speaking; the mic stays open until you finish or explicitly pause.
- Shared-document comments now live in the text-selection toolbar instead of overlapping it.
- MCP servers disabled in Settings no longer load in Claude Code (SDK) sessions; the disable toggle now governs both the CLI and SDK paths.
- Directory grouping now handles Windows paths consistently across session edits, commit proposals, and Git history.
- Stopping a running Codex session (including from mobile) now interrupts it immediately instead of leaving it stuck showing as running.
- Answering an interactive prompt from mobile — approving a plan, granting a tool permission, or answering a question — now works across every agent instead of silently doing nothing on non-Claude-Code sessions.
- Tracker status badges and custom columns no longer vanish after a synced update; they stay put instead of blanking out until the next reload.

### Removed

## [0.68.1] - 2026-07-10


### Added
<!-- New features go here -->

### Changed
<!-- Changes to existing functionality go here -->
- New projects now derive their tracker issue-key prefix from the project name instead of always using `NIM`.

### Added
<!-- New features go here -->
- OpenCode presets now include GLM 5.2 through the Z.AI and Z.AI Coding Plan providers.
- GPT-5.6 (Sol, Terra, and Luna) is available for the OpenAI and Codex agents, with Sol as the new default.

### Changed
- Any extension can now enable a native-code backend module, approved once via a single consent prompt instead of an allowlist or a per-workspace dialog.
- Tracker link chips in chat now show more of the item title before truncating.

### Fixed
<!-- Bug fixes go here -->

- The Claude Usage popover now shows the Claude provider icon instead of a generic layers icon.
- Editing a markdown file with em dashes or curly quotes no longer corrupts the text into `â` symbols or traps it in a reload loop.
- File links to paths with spaces (e.g. `My Project`) now stay clickable in chat instead of breaking at the first space.
- Sidebar resize handles now keep responding while dragged over a mockup preview.
- Codex/ChatGPT sessions no longer reject Nimbalyst's own tools with "user rejected MCP tool call".

## [0.67.3] - 2026-07-09


### Added
<!-- New features go here -->

### Changed
<!-- Changes to existing functionality go here -->

### Fixed
<!-- Bug fixes go here -->
- Claude Code no longer breaks after an app update on Windows, and a broken install now shows an honest "repair Nimbalyst" message instead of a misleading libc error.

### Removed
<!-- Removed features go here -->

## [0.67.2] - 2026-07-08


### Added
<!-- New features go here -->
- Shared folders are now first-class: right-click a folder in Shared Items to rename, move, copy a link, or delete it (with a count-based confirmation), drag folders and documents to reorganize, and let an AI agent create or reorganize shared files and folders — reorganizing never breaks a document's local link.
- Advanced setting to route Claude Code CLI (Subscription) traffic through a custom local API proxy (e.g. a token-compression or caching layer).
- Shared Docs discovery home: search, favorites, recently opened, and docs new or changed since you last viewed them, with a sidebar filter (All / Favorites / Updated) and controls to hide or clear unread markers.
- Tools & Token Cost settings panel: see every tool group's estimated context-token cost and load policy in one place, with a link from the AI panel's token meter.
- iOS: create a Meta Agent on mobile and see it grouped with its sub-agents in a collapsible "Meta Agent" group (alpha-gated to the desktop feature flag).
- Slash commands, `@` file references, and `@@` session mentions now appear as tinted pills anywhere in a chat message; slash-command pills stay clickable to show what each command does and open its source file.
- Unread indicators mark trackers and shared docs that have changed since you last viewed them.

### Changed
<!-- Changes to existing functionality go here -->
- Trim the session model picker: each provider's settings page has checkboxes to hide models you don't use, and the Claude Agent SDK and Claude Code CLI sets can be enabled or disabled independently.
- Agent sessions no longer include tracker guidance in the system prompt when trackers are disabled for the workspace, reducing per-request token usage.

### Fixed
<!-- Bug fixes go here -->
- Scheduled interval automations now fire on time instead of silently never running, and an automation whose due time passed while the app was closed runs once on next open.
- Agent sessions defer MCP tool definitions until used on all models, and multi-worktree projects no longer load duplicate copies of project commands.
- Background agents launched by a session are no longer killed when the session's turn ends; the session stays alive and wakes when they finish.
- Sync: meta agents and their spawned sub-agents now group together on mobile in real time instead of only after a full resync.
- Shared documents created while team sync was still connecting no longer go missing from the Shared Items tree; their registration is now queued and completed once sync attaches.
- OpenAI chat model selection works again.
- Plan items show fresh updated timestamps in the tracker table, and spurious tracker timestamp churn is stopped.

### Removed
<!-- Removed features go here -->

## [0.67.1] - 2026-07-07


### Added
<!-- New features go here -->
- Double-click an editor tab to maximize the editor area in Files, Agent, and Shared Docs modes, then double-click again to restore the previous layout.
- Customize the navigation gutter: hide or show any icon and drag to reorder them via a Customize Gutter popover (right-click the gutter), with preferences applied across all projects.
- The Pull Requests view now connects to trackers and sessions: review-status badges and filter chips, one-click jumps between a PR, its tracker item, and its review session, linking any tracker item to a PR, and merges update linked tracker items automatically.
- Tracker kanban cards can show an item's external identity (like a PR number) next to its issue key via the new externalKey schema role.

### Changed
<!-- Changes to existing functionality go here -->

### Fixed
- Claude Agent sessions now recover a turn whose stream closes mid-response instead of losing the reply.
- Git branch watching no longer crawls the entire workspace, cutting CPU and disk churn in large projects.
- Reduce lost project states on reopen.
- Shared extension-editor documents (CSV, data model, mindmap) no longer come back empty or wipe the shared copy after close and reopen, and re-uploading a local file into a shared document now checks for conflicts before overwriting.
- Marketplace extension installs no longer hang mid-extraction and fail with "reply was never sent".
- Settings navigation: the Marketplace item now works in project scope, and the Privileged Capabilities item now works in all scopes.
- Mockup share links now render full-size in the browser instead of a tiny square.
- Android prompt input is no longer hidden by the soft keyboard when typing in a session.
- Android prompt input no longer drops words while typing when the desktop echoes back a synced draft.
- Android interactive widget responses (Commit, Allow, Approve, AskUserQuestion Submit) now reach the desktop session instead of silently doing nothing.
- Mobile project list no longer holds onto projects that the server has dropped from the sync snapshot, and no longer wipes itself when a transient decryption failure shrinks the snapshot.

### Removed
<!-- Removed features go here -->

## [0.66.10] - 2026-07-04


### Added
<!-- New features go here -->
- Sync settings now show a per-project document-sync status (connected, file count, or an error) so you can tell whether mobile document sync is working.

### Changed
<!-- Changes to existing functionality go here -->
- The New File menu now scrolls when long, lists file types by name (Markdown first, the rest alphabetical), and no longer shows a duplicate Mockup entry.
- Refreshed the extension marketplace: updated all published extensions and added Browser, Calc Sheets, GitHub Issues Importer, and Memory
- Voice mode: the assistant now replies more briefly and no longer asks you to approve tasks that auto-send after the on-screen countdown.

### Fixed
- Tracker item content no longer renders as raw JSON text after closing and reopening the item.
- Interactive input prompts no longer collapse into plain chat if you take longer than 5 minutes to answer.
- Open custom-editor tabs (e.g. Replicad, Excalidraw) now refresh when an agent edits the file, instead of staying stale until closed and reopened.
- Claude Code sessions now end with an error instead of spinning forever if the agent stream silently stalls.
- iOS: session badges now label Fable 5 and Sonnet 5 sessions instead of showing a generic "Claude Agent" fallback.
- The Claude Code model picker now always shows every available model, so Fable 5 and other variants can no longer go missing.
- Mobile document sync now propagates `.md` deletions to your other devices and reconnects after you change sync settings, instead of silently leaving later edits unsynced.
- Clicking a relative file link in a markdown doc now opens the file in a tab instead of a blank white window; external links open in your browser.

### Removed
<!-- Removed features go here -->

## [0.66.9] - 2026-07-02


### Added
<!-- New features go here -->

### Changed
<!-- Changes to existing functionality go here -->
- Built-in extensions no longer show the native-code consent prompt; it now only appears for third-party extensions.

### Fixed
<!-- Bug fixes go here -->
- Gemini (Antigravity) agent and meta-agent turns no longer come back empty after the agent runs a tool that returns no results.
- Agent calls to deferred background tools (Monitor et al) no longer fail with schema validation errors.

### Removed
<!-- Removed features go here -->

## [0.66.8] - 2026-07-02


### Added
<!-- New features go here -->

### Changed
<!-- Changes to existing functionality go here -->
- The iOS voice agent now runs the same gpt-realtime-2 model and session configuration as desktop, with automatic fallback when the model is unavailable.

### Fixed
<!-- Bug fixes go here -->
- Built-in extensions are once again included in packaged builds; a dependency regression had silently dropped them from released apps.
- The memory extension now starts in packaged builds instead of failing to load its bundled dependencies.
- Agent sessions that launch background tasks now wake and continue when those tasks finish, instead of the task being cancelled at the end of the turn.
- Voice mode no longer interrupts itself from echo of its own speech on open speakers (desktop and iOS).
- The voice selected in iOS Settings (or synced from desktop) is now actually used by the voice agent.

### Removed
<!-- Removed features go here -->

## [0.66.7] - 2026-07-01


### Added
<!-- New features go here -->
- Memory recall/search tool calls now show a transcript card with the query and matched source documents, with click-to-open.

### Changed
<!-- Changes to existing functionality go here -->

### Fixed
- Toggling an extension on/off via an AI agent now actually restarts its backend module, and importer crash errors now include the real failure reason instead of just "crashed".
- Git worktrees with branch-style names (e.g. `feature/x`) and a project's own subfolders now inherit the parent project's agent permissions instead of re-prompting for every tool call, while a separate repository nested inside a trusted folder still prompts on its own.
- On Windows, clicking a file link in chat now opens the file instead of a blank window.
- Claude Code background sub-agents are no longer killed when the lead agent's turn ends; the agent keeps waiting for them and is told if one is interrupted.
- Tracker status changes now work for custom tracker types that rename their workflow status field.
- Tracker reference links (`nimbalyst://` chips) in chat no longer render blank.

### Removed
<!-- Removed features go here -->

## [0.66.6] - 2026-07-01


### Added
- Nimbalyst-branded Android launcher icon, replacing the generic Android stock icon.
- Claude Sonnet 5 is now selectable across the Claude chat, Claude Agent, and Claude Code CLI providers (Sonnet 4.6 remains available as a pinned choice).
- Start a new coding session by voice — say "create a new session" on desktop or mobile; on mobile it now opens the new session automatically on the device you asked from.
- The mobile floating mic shows what the voice agent is doing — an animated ring and a tool icon appear while it runs a tool.
- Voice mode on mobile can now find sessions by topic, switch sessions, summarize a session (including the agent's latest notes and any question it's waiting on), answer a session's pending question by voice, and send coding tasks to your desktop.
- Choose the voice model and reasoning level in Voice Mode settings.
- Dart syntax highlighting in the Monaco editor.

### Changed
- Claude Code CLI sessions defer MCP tool schema loading, cutting baseline context usage.

### Fixed
- New AI sessions now appear immediately instead of waiting for sync to connect.
- Linking tracker items now reliably updates both sides and no longer goes stale or drops an item's other links after syncing — including when the AI sets the link.
- Tracker relationship fields no longer get cleared or dropped by concurrent syncs.
- Structured prompts stay visible in the transcript when tool calls are hidden.
- Windows: Claude Code CLI sessions launch reliably, including with multi-line system prompts.
- Mobile voice mode now shows clear Pause and Cancel buttons by the floating mic, so a single tap reliably pauses or stops voice mode.
- Another session can now read an OpenAI Codex session's last reply through the session-summary tools, matching Claude Code sessions.
- Voice mode now always speaks in your configured preferred language, including on mobile, instead of sometimes starting up in a different language.
- The iOS voice agent now reliably speaks its response when it wakes up after a coding agent finishes a task.
- Voice replies no longer speed up or skip near the end of longer responses.
- Mobile voice replies no longer garble, overlap, or click — responses play one at a time and fade out cleanly when you interrupt.

<!-- Removed features go here -->

## [0.66.5] - 2026-06-26


### Added
- Reference a tracker item from any document or AI chat: type `#` to pick an existing item and insert a live chip showing its current status and title (filter by type with `bug:`, search by key or title), with a one-click way to turn a legacy inline tracker into a real tracked item. The AI now links tracker items as clickable chips too.
- New Nimbalyst Memory extension: indexes your project notes and surfaces relevant facts to the AI and voice agent for grounded answers.
- Global semantic search in Quick Open (Cmd+Shift+O): find any tracker or document by meaning, with an option to include past AI sessions; available when the Nimbalyst Memory extension is enabled.
- Extensions can now contribute tools and session context to the voice agent.
- Ask the voice agent to open a past AI session by topic (e.g. "open the most recent session working on the collaborative document system"); it finds sessions by what they worked on, not just their title, when the Nimbalyst Memory extension is enabled.
- Search box on the Installed Extensions settings pane to filter the list.
- Optional "Shared" column in the tracker table shows whether each item is shared with the team or local-only.
- Database Browser maintenance action to reclaim space used by old Claude Code sessions, with an optional compaction step.
- Copy a shareable link to a team shared document from the editor header.
- Share and co-edit more document types in real time, including spreadsheets and code files, not just markdown.

### Changed
- Claude Code sessions store and sync far less redundant data (no more full original-file copies on every edit), shrinking the local database and mobile transfers.
- Updating a tracker item no longer links it to the current AI session unless you ask, so sessions stop accumulating items the agent merely touched.
- Collab mode's document tree and AI chat panels can now be collapsed, and the layout is remembered per workspace.
- Linked sessions now appear at the top of a tracker item's detail, so you can jump back into a session without scrolling past the description and comments.

### Fixed
- AI session status no longer stays stuck on "running" in the mobile app after a turn finishes on desktop.
- Stop prompting to run the Gemini backend at startup; it now starts only when you actually use Gemini.
- Remove a stray "[Full message elided...]" bubble that appeared in the mobile transcript but not on desktop.
- Tracker item detail no longer gets stuck on "Connecting…" when the team lookup hangs; it falls back to local mode.
- Tracker type counts no longer briefly flash "0" while tracker data is still loading.
- Reopened secondary projects now scope the tracker list to the correct project instead of the startup project's items.
- Fixed tracker field corruption on the SQLite backend caused by merging JSON updates.
- Shared documents no longer get stuck on a blank "Offline – unsynced changes" editor when a session token was scoped to the wrong org.
- Shared document bodies written before a team's encryption-key rotation now decrypt and load instead of opening blank.
- Shared documents whose name contains spaces or other special characters now open instead of failing to sync.
- Committing no longer triggers a burst of slow database queries that briefly hitched the app.
- Excalidraw drawings shared with the team no longer open blank or render with a light canvas in dark mode.
- Reopening a shared document in Shared Docs mode no longer instantly closes the tab.
- Windows: Claude Code CLI chat sessions now start instead of failing immediately on launch. (#684)

### Removed
<!-- Removed features go here -->

## [0.66.3] - 2026-06-23


### Added
<!-- New features go here -->
- Share a plan with your team straight from the tracker — a Share toggle in the tracker item view publishes the plan to the team's shared tracker.
- Team admins can re-share the current encryption key with all members from Settings → Security & encryption, fixing teammates who saw "Encrypted document (key unavailable)".

### Changed
<!-- Changes to existing functionality go here -->

### Fixed
<!-- Bug fixes go here -->
- Extension AI tools (such as OpenSCAD and Replicad) no longer revert your recent file edits by saving stale editor content over them.
- Shared document names no longer show as scrambled text after a team turns on managed encryption, and are recovered even when the team's encryption key was rotated.

## [0.66.0] - 2026-06-22


### Added
- Custom completion sounds — pick your own audio file (MP3, WAV, OGG, M4A, AAC, FLAC) to play when an agent finishes a turn.
<!-- New features go here -->
- iOS: create a Meta Agent from the session create menu (alpha-gated to mirror the desktop `meta-agent` feature flag, synced to mobile).
- New Gemini (Antigravity) marketplace extension, usable as an AI chat and meta-agent provider, with a usage indicator chip. (#558)
- New RTL Support extension: auto-detects right-to-left languages (Arabic, Hebrew, Persian, etc.) and renders the transcript and input correctly, with a settings panel and toggle shortcut. (#638)
- Real-time team document collaboration (alpha): share documents across editor types and edit them together live.
- Org and project management (alpha): move a project between orgs and merge orgs with guided wizards, plus org-scoped settings.
- `/session-cleanup` command (Planning extension) tidies your Sessions board: it proposes phase corrections and "mark complete" candidates for your approval, and flags old sessions to archive.
- `nim`, a companion CLI for trackers: list, create, update, comment on, archive, and import tracker items from the terminal — through a running Nimbalyst, or directly against the database when the app is closed.
- Link tracker items to one another with relationship fields: typeahead pills in the table and detail panel, plus automatic "Linked from" backlinks.
- New tracker views — a tag board, saved views (filter and group), and kanban columns that follow each type's custom status order.
- Customize or reset a tracker type's schema from Settings, with a drift warning when the saved schema diverges from its files.
- Edit and delete your own tracker comments.
- Share individual plans (and other full-document trackers) with your team: the shared copy keeps its status, lifecycle, and body in sync — including changes made offline — and unsharing removes it for everyone, while unshared items stay private.
- Control whether AI agents can use your trackers per project, with an "AI Agent Access" toggle in tracker settings.
- Android app variant with email/magic-link sign-in, push notifications, deep links, and pairing QR scanner. (#663)

### Changed
- Contextual tips now fill empty AI sessions immediately and on every empty session, instead of after a delay and only once per app launch.

### Fixed
- Sign-in now completes on Linux AppImage builds — the `nimbalyst://` URL handler is registered at startup so the OAuth browser callback reopens the app correctly.
- Startup is fast again after restart: a transcript maintenance pass that could stall the app for tens of seconds on large histories is now deferred until after the first window loads.
- AI tools for custom editors (diagrams, CAD, etc.) no longer revert a change the agent just wrote to a file that isn't open in a tab.
- The Themes, Shared Links, and Database settings panels now open instead of snapping back to the first agent provider.
- A session can now spawn child sessions again after several have finished — the limit is on how many run at once, not a lifetime total.
- The welcome dialog no longer re-appears on a slow or busy startup after you've already completed onboarding.
- Restarting the app no longer occasionally loses your open project windows and drops you back on the Workspace Manager.
- The Claude Code context indicator now updates throughout a turn instead of only at the end, and no longer bounces when sub-agents run.
- Personal docs sync no longer overwrites newer local edits (or an open editor's unsaved changes) with an older synced copy.
- "Commit with AI" in a worktree now proposes all uncommitted changes in the worktree, not just the current session's edits.
- Claude Code CLI sessions now show an install link when the Claude Code CLI isn't installed, instead of a cryptic terminal error.
- The Claude Code login prompt no longer falsely reports "logged in" when the bundled Claude runtime is missing, and now suggests running /login in a terminal if sign-in keeps failing.
- Commit with AI (and other in-app git actions) now run hooks with your shell PATH, so husky hooks that call yarn/node no longer fail with "command not found". (#643)
- Stop the AskUserQuestion widget from crashing when a question is missing its options.
- Deleting a custom tracker type no longer fails on the SQLite backend.
- Launching a sibling session from a normal session no longer moves it (and the new session) into the Meta Agent group in the session list.
- Tracker items from one project no longer leak into another project's panel.
- The tracker detail panel no longer overwrites custom field edits made elsewhere while it's open.
- Personal and settings sync no longer gets stuck when a stale stored account id blocked the personal sync connection.
- Tracker table columns for custom fields (such as PR links, author, and number in the GitHub PRs tracker) no longer render blank.
- AI agents reading a tracker item now see its custom fields (such as a GitHub PR's number and author), which were previously omitted from the item's details.
- Tracker types shared via team sync now persist across restarts (including synced overrides of built-in types), and synced tracker items no longer silently fail to save on some databases.
- A session no longer gets stuck showing "awaiting user input" when an interactive prompt is abandoned (e.g. you send a new message instead of answering it).
- Mode-switch keyboard shortcuts now work while a fullscreen extension panel is open — they exit the panel first.

### Changed
<!-- Changes to existing functionality go here -->

### Fixed
- Lost-model fallback no longer silently sends paid 1M context; 1M is only used when you explicitly pick a 1M model. (#631)
- "Allow All" permission mode auto-approves everything again; the Claude Code safety classifier is now opt-in per project. (#628)
- No more Electron crash when a worktree produces a filesystem-event storm. (#629)
- Auto-commit retries when another git process briefly holds .git/index.lock, so concurrent sessions commit on the first try.
- Background Claude Code CLI sessions no longer spawn (and hit rate limits) when the app is reactivated.
- Claude Code CLI: the "Thinking…" indicator no longer sticks off after you answer a question.
- Claude Code CLI: a typed slash command no longer runs the autocomplete-highlighted command instead.

- Claude Code CLI sessions no longer get stuck showing a "Processing…" spinner after their turn finishes.
- Namespaced extension slash commands (e.g. /feedback:bug-report) now resolve in Claude Code CLI sessions instead of failing.
- Generated extension-workflow plugins now load in Claude Code CLI sessions, with broader CLI version support for plugin loading.

## [0.65.2] - 2026-06-12


### Added
<!-- New features go here -->

### Changed
<!-- Changes to existing functionality go here -->

### Fixed
<!-- Bug fixes go here -->
- Claude Code CLI sessions can now spawn sessions via the meta-agent tools, and prompts sent to them while closed (spawned sessions, restart continuations, scheduled wakeups) launch the CLI and deliver instead of failing.
- Smart Commit and other queued prompts on Claude Code CLI sessions no longer linger in the queued list after they run.
- The CLI terminal drawer no longer steals keyboard focus from the chat input when ordinary terminal output looks like a picker.
- Linked tracker items now show up and survive linking additional items on the SQLite backend, and commits link to session trackers again.
- Stopping an already-idle Claude Code CLI session no longer quits the CLI and leaves the session unresponsive.
- Claude Agent startup crashes now log detailed spawn diagnostics and auto-capture a CLI debug log on retry, and the real error message reaches the renderer log (#614).
- HTML preview renders again instead of a blank pane (or a Windows Store popup), and in-workspace files on Windows are no longer rejected over drive-letter casing (#612, #625).

### Removed
<!-- Removed features go here -->

## [0.65.1] - 2026-06-12


### Added
<!-- New features go here -->
- Claude Fable 5 is now selectable across all Claude providers, including a Fable 5 (1M) variant; existing Fable defaults migrate to 1M automatically.
- Switch models mid-session on Claude Code CLI sessions from the model picker.
- Claude Code CLI sessions receive your active document and selection as context, support workspace slash commands and the memory widget, and auto-name themselves from the first prompt.
- Toggle the raw-terminal drawer with Ctrl+Shift+`; hover help on the model picker explains the Claude Agent vs Claude Code CLI choice.

### Changed
<!-- Changes to existing functionality go here -->

### Fixed
<!-- Bug fixes go here -->
- Stopping a Claude Code CLI turn now reliably interrupts the CLI, and queued prompts no longer get stuck near turn boundaries.
- API failures in Claude Code CLI sessions surface in the transcript without false alarms at session startup.
- The raw-terminal drawer stays closed once you collapse it and no longer steals keyboard focus from the chat input.
- Files Edited sidebar updates immediately as Claude Code CLI sessions edit files.
- Fixed the whole app freezing permanently after closing a terminal that had rendered emoji output.
- Terminal Retry now actually recovers a failed initialization, and a slow-starting backend auto-recovers without clicking Retry.
- Claude Code CLI raw terminal no longer double-paints or mis-wraps its display after restoring a session.
- Fable 5 sessions no longer hit a false 200k context ceiling: selecting Fable resolves to a model the Claude Agent SDK accepts, and the context indicator matches the CLI's real window.
- Claude Code CLI sessions no longer appear disconnected after switching sessions — the terminal reattaches even while its drawer is collapsed.

### Removed
<!-- Removed features go here -->

## [0.65.0] - 2026-06-09


### Added
- Run agent sessions on the genuine Claude Code CLI using your Claude Pro/Max subscription (no API metering), with the same live transcript, file tracking, and interactive prompts as the built-in agents — plus a resizable raw-terminal drawer that auto-reveals when the CLI opens a native picker (`/model`, `/login`, …).
- Import GitHub issues into the tracker as native bug, task, or feature items that link back to the source, with one-click re-snapshot to pull the latest title, status, and body. Uses your installed `gh` login.

### Changed
<!-- Changes to existing functionality go here -->

### Fixed
- Restarting the app no longer relaunches every Claude Code CLI session at once (which stampeded the subscription rate limit and failed turns) — only the focused window's session resumes; background windows resume when you switch to them.
- Smart Commit (and any queued prompt) on a Claude Code CLI session now runs immediately instead of sitting queued when the CLI is idle.
- In Multi-Project mode, a project's tracker list no longer shows another open project's items. (#591)
- Docs a session just created now sync to mobile immediately, and tapping their transcript link on mobile waits for the doc to sync instead of dead-ending with "not synced to this device".
- Launching an action in a new session with a different provider's model (e.g. "Implement in Codex" from a Claude session) no longer fails with a model-identifier error.
- Synced tracker item bodies containing lists or links now load for teammates instead of appearing blank.
- Voice mode connects again after OpenAI retired the Realtime Beta API (migrated desktop and iOS to the GA shape).
- Renaming or moving a project no longer fails and rolls back on the SQLite backend.
- Quick Open remembers your filter selections, and file-mask filters now return matching results.

- Built-in PR review mode (Cmd/Ctrl+U): browse, filter, diff, comment on, and approve/merge PRs using your existing `gh` login; open a PR into a worktree with an agent session. (#307)
- Auto session mode for Claude Code: safe actions run silently, only uncertain ones prompt, when workspace trust is "Allow All". (#379)
- Inline comments on shared documents: select text to comment, reply in @-mention threads, and resolve, synced live across collaborators.
- Browser tabs for HTML preview (Cmd+Shift+B), plus browser tools that agents can drive.
- Quick Open's Sessions tab now searches message contents, not just titles.
- Clickable file paths in AI transcripts.
- Refresh button in the Files Mode sidebar header. (#259)
- Calc Sheets ship a Falcon 9 demo with custom syntax coloring.
- Sync WebSocket connections report platform and version for connect/disconnect telemetry.
- Expanded extension release and share-viewer support.

### Fixed
- Effort Level selector now takes effect instead of always running at "high".
- Context usage breakdown opens on click, no longer blocking the queued-prompt controls. (#429)
- Chat box no longer leaks keystrokes into a file an agent is editing.
- `.calc.md` files and shared calc sheets render in the Calc Sheet/Monaco editor again.
- Inline tracker edits save for id-less markers, and due dates persist across a re-scan. (#404)
- Truncated session names now show in full on hover. (#577)
- Local markdown links open correctly, resolving relative paths from the current document.
- Session images can be copied; transcript images are zoomable, uncropped, and persist across reloads. (#580)
- LM Studio uses the loaded model ID; Opus 4.8 aliases resolve without falling back to Sonnet; OpenCode slash autocomplete works. (#143)
- Generated Codex workflows preserve their command arguments.
- Multi-Project rail is preserved on reload, and automations run in the active rail project. (#544, #557)
- New workspaces default to Documents on Windows.
- Broken markdown embed commands are hidden; the keep-awake tip only shows when eligible.
- Browser toolbar and URL bar respect the active theme in dark mode.
- Restored diff application in headless mode.

- AI Usage Report no longer crashes the app on the SQLite backend.
- Terminal scrollback is preserved when it contains a stray NUL byte, instead of discarding all saved history.
- Claude Code session token totals in the AI Usage Report are no longer inflated.
- Tracker tool widgets no longer crash on the SQLite backend over a JSON-string `type_tags` column.

## [0.64.0] - 2026-06-03


### Added
- Claude Opus 4.8 is now selectable in the Claude provider (1M context, dateless ID `claude-opus-4-8`) and is the default Claude model for new installs. (#473)
- Claude Code variants `opus-4-7` and `opus-4-7-1m` pinned to Opus 4.7 so it stays selectable after the canonical `opus` alias was bumped to 4.8. (#473)
- Extension themes can contribute Monaco editor themes via an optional `monaco` block in `contributions.themes[]`, defining `base`, `rules`, and `colors`. Monaco-backed editors register the theme dynamically and switch to it when the user activates the theme; omitting the block keeps the previous `vs` / `vs-dark` fallback.
- Claude Code sessions now show a Task List panel in the right sidebar with the agent's SDK-native task queue (TaskCreate/TaskUpdate), including status, owner, and blocked-by dependencies.
<!-- New features go here -->

### Changed
<!-- Changes to existing functionality go here -->
- Default Claude model bumped from `claude-opus-4-7` to `claude-opus-4-8`. Existing sessions keep their configured model; only new sessions and "reset to default" pick up 4.8. (#473)
- Bumped `@openai/codex-sdk` from 0.130.0 to 0.136.0; updated the binary path resolver for the new `vendor/<triple>/bin/codex` and `codex-path/` layout.

### Fixed
<!-- Bug fixes go here -->
- Claude Code sessions on Opus 4.8 now actually run on 4.8 (#531) Upgraded `@anthropic-ai/claude-agent-sdk` to 0.3.161 (and `@anthropic-ai/sdk` to 0.100.1 for its peer requirement).
- Commit proposal diff peeks use the normal default size again instead of collapsing to a tiny bottom-right popover.
- Quick Open file search no longer lags because hidden tabs stop re-rendering on each keystroke.
- Fixed an EPIPE feedback loop where the main-process uncaught-exception handler re-entered itself when stderr was broken on Linux, flooding the log until the process died.
- Meta-agent child sessions now inherit the parent session's provider and model instead of silently falling back to a Claude/Opus default for non-Claude parents.
- iOS: fast typing into the prompt input no longer jumbles characters; synced drafts are no longer applied while the compose field has keyboard focus.
- iOS: switching back to a recently-viewed session is now instant — the transcript keeps up to 3 sessions warm and no longer waits on the sync round-trip to reveal already-local messages.
- iOS: fixed the transcript bundle failing to build (and shrank it ~3.8MB) by stopping a tool widget from importing the runtime barrel, which dragged the Anthropic SDK into the browser bundle.
- "Commit with AI" now prompts the agent to include relevant, commitable, side-effect files.
- Localhost `/clip` endpoint now rejects requests from arbitrary web pages, accepting only extension-origin JSON requests.

### Changed
<!-- Changes to existing functionality go here -->

### Fixed
- AI edits to markdown files with inline base64 images no longer trigger multi-minute main-process beachballs.
- Tool calls no longer get stuck at "running" when multiple AI sessions are open.
- Workstream parent sessions now rise to the top when a child session becomes active.
- AskUserQuestion, ExitPlanMode, and GitCommitProposal widgets now render via MCP-prefixed tool names.
- Workspace search now caches the resolved ripgrep path instead of reprobe-logging on every keystroke.
- Quick Open no longer stalls while listing prompts, and older prompts now appear in results again.
- Tracker labels no longer crash the backfill on reconnect or gain a phantom leading `null` on SQLite.
- New Worktree no longer stays disabled in git repos when the initial probe races mount.
- Calc Sheets PARSE ERR rows are legible in dark mode.
- Document-edit usage analytics no longer crash on either database backend.
- Database backups now clean up stranded temp files and catch up after sleep or startup gaps.
- Database Browser now shows SQLite backup sizes.

### Added
<!-- New features go here -->

### Changed
- Canonical transcript events kept in-memory per session and rebuilt from raw messages on demand instead of persisted to disk.
- Agent-message search index now mirrors extractor output, keeping tool noise and metadata chunks out of search results.

### Fixed
- Multi-minute startup beachball for users with many shared trackers; document-sync key-fingerprint check is now single-flighted and cached, and tracker prewarm is debounced.
- Marketplace `.nimext` packages now ship the `claude-plugin/` directory so installed extensions can register their Claude skills.
- Pending-files query no longer throws `json_extract` errors on PGLite installs.
- Claude Code mid-turn widgets (commit proposal, etc.) now appear in the background-session view as the turn streams, not only after the next session load.

### Changed
<!-- Changes to existing functionality go here -->

### Fixed
- Auto-updater no longer pops a giant "Cannot find latest-mac.yml ... HttpError: 404" toast on background polls when a release is mid-publish. Treats the 404 the same as "no update available" until the workflow finishes uploading metadata; manual checks see a friendly "release is being published" message instead of the raw HttpError.
- Release builds no longer fail on CI when the afterPack worker-bundle ABI check times out spawning the unsigned Electron binary. The path-resolution and `.node`-presence checks remain fatal (those catch the packaging-miss class); only the Electron-as-Node boot probe is now informational.

### Removed
<!-- Removed features go here -->

## [0.63.2] - 2026-06-01


### Added
- Claude Opus 4.8 is now selectable in the Claude provider (1M context, dateless ID `claude-opus-4-8`) and is the default Claude model for new installs. (#473)
- Claude Code variants `opus-4-7` and `opus-4-7-1m` pinned to Opus 4.7 so it stays selectable after the canonical `opus` alias was bumped to 4.8. (#473)
<!-- New features go here -->
- Calc Sheets: a new `.calc.md` custom editor for line-oriented worksheets with units, currency-aware evaluation, assertions, Monaco-based editing, and a live result gutter.
- Alpha SQLite storage backend behind an opt-in Settings → Database migration. Dry-run reports row counts and integrity against your live PGLite without touching it; the real migration preserves PGLite at `pglite-db.migrated-<ts>/` for rollback. WriteCoordinator batches writes through a single lane and chunks slow ops on a background lane; FTS5 mirrors back agent-message and transcript-event search; Database Browser gains a Performance tab.
- Worktree git panel now has a Manual/Smart commit toggle and "Commit with AI" button, matching the non-worktree experience.
- Contextual tips: small bottom-left cards that suggest tracker mode, worktree sessions, the keyboard-shortcuts dialog, and theme exploration based on local feature usage.
- Tip body now renders basic markdown (paragraphs, bullets, bold).
- Empty AI session panels now cycle through 15 additional contextual tips: the four embedded editors (Excalidraw, MockupLM, DataModelLM, spreadsheets), shared session and document links, CLAUDE.md standing instructions, auto-commit mode, document history (Cmd+Y), quick open (Cmd+O), content search (Cmd+Shift+F), mobile pairing, scheduled wakeups, action prompts, and the lightning interrupt button.
- Session history search supports a virtual `#worktree` tag that filters to all worktree sessions and their children.
- Shared Documents file tree now has inline search by document name or folder path.
- Unified Quick Open: one tabbed dialog replaces the four separate Files / Sessions / Prompts / Projects quick-open dialogs, adds a real Trackers tab, a comma-separated file-mask filter (same syntax as the git extension) on Files / In Files, and a type filter on Trackers. ⌘O / ⌘⇧F / ⌘L / ⌘⇧L / ⌘⇧P each open the unified dialog on their tab and also jump between tabs while it's open.

### Changed
<!-- Changes to existing functionality go here -->
- Main-process startup now logs event-loop lag, per-batch progress in `ProjectFileSyncService.buildManifest`/`handleSyncResponse`, per-phase timing in `document-sync:open`, and per-request elapsed time in `TeamService.fetchTeamApi` to diagnose multi-minute startup freezes.
- Default Claude model bumped from `claude-opus-4-7` to `claude-opus-4-8`. Existing sessions keep their configured model; only new sessions and "reset to default" pick up 4.8. (#473)
- Monaco editor host wrappers now support custom load/save content transforms so extensions can present normalized editor views while preserving richer on-disk source formats.
- Bumping a tip or walkthrough version now re-shows it even if the prior version was completed or dismissed.
- The alpha SQLite backend now migrates session, transcript, tracker, and document stores more completely, with worker-backed execution and expanded validation/adoption flows to keep large migrations and database browsing responsive.
- Blitz, Super Loops, and Meta Agent now appear in the new-session menu for any user with their alpha feature enabled, instead of being hidden behind developer mode. (#438)
- Transcript tool-call diff enrichment moved to the main process, removing per-render IPC chatter from the renderer.
- Cloudflare session sync now clamps payloads more aggressively and routes metadata-only index updates through a lightweight path to cut server write churn.

### Fixed
<!-- Bug fixes go here -->
- Primary buttons pick a readable label color on light/pastel theme accents instead of hardcoded white. (#504)
- Packaged better-sqlite3 binaries validated during build to catch broken native modules before release.
- PromptForUserInput widget no longer crashes with "Cannot read properties of undefined" when the agent emits a malformed field. (#494)
- AI sessions no longer appear to keep running forever on the mobile app after a desktop turn ends; v0.63.0 routed the "isExecuting" signal through a new lightweight wire message the server and iOS did not yet understand, so the running indicator never cleared.
- Lexical selection-toolbar format dropdowns now render inside the editor root when portaled, so shared dropdown styling and theme backgrounds no longer disappear.
- AskUserQuestion widget no longer goes blank (header-only "Waiting..." with no options) after switching from Agent mode to Files mode and back when the same session is open in both panels.
- Mobile sync no longer wastes per-session storage on transient Codex app-server delta and diff-update events, preventing noisy sessions from tripping the 10 MB SessionRoom cap too early.
- Codex sessions no longer persist transient app-server notifications (message/reasoning deltas, token-usage updates, MCP startup status, thread lifecycle) to the local raw log; only durable item/turn/error events are kept, cutting per-session DB churn for long Codex runs.
- Claude Code sessions no longer persist transient SDK chunks (hook lifecycle, task progress, tool progress, auth status, rate-limit events) to the local raw log or sync them, since they never render in the canonical transcript.
- Codex app-server transcripts no longer duplicate commit proposal widgets or final messages when repeated item/turn notifications arrive.
- SQLite migration now reconciles final PGLite writes before cutover, rollback works after SQLite is active, voice-mode session resume no longer depends on PG-only interval SQL, and SQLite-backed analytics no longer hit PostgreSQL-only queries.
- Sessions resumed from queued prompts now stay marked running until the continuation actually finishes, so the session dashboard and background-task UI no longer flip to idle mid-turn.
- Sessions no longer get stuck in the running state after the final queued-prompt continuation completes; the dispatcher now ends the session once the queue chain fully drains.
- Embedded calc sheets and other inline custom editors no longer immediately lose focus after the second click used to enter the embedded editor.
- Agent transcript no longer collapses `$7M ... $40M`-style currency text into LaTeX. (#462)
- Markdown-led transcript file change cards no longer append sibling embedded editor previews like Excalidraw beneath the markdown diff.
- Tracker table view now gives the Type column enough width to show its header and icon instead of collapsing to a clipped sliver.
- Smart commit in worktree sessions now resolves session-edited files against the worktree path, so the cross-reference with git status correctly matches.
- Blitz no longer silently dismisses the dialog when run against a workspace whose git repo has no commits. (#455)
- Share to Team now seeds new shared extension documents into the collab room before publishing the link, so teammates no longer open blank MockupLM docs when they join immediately.
- Re-uploading a shared MockupLM document now resolves the correct collab content adapter for `.mockup.html` and `.mockupproject` files.
- Shared-document history now records bootstrap and manual revisions reliably; Cmd/Ctrl+S inside a collab editor creates a manual revision, and Restore waits for pending writes to settle before bailing on transient sync status.
- Session history no longer pegs the renderer at 100% CPU during AI streaming.
- Slow `getPendingFilesForSession` query that compounded the streaming slowdown now uses a partial expression index and a short-lived cache.
- Monaco editor now picks the right dark or light base theme for extension themes whose IDs don't include `-dark` (e.g. rose-pine), so the editor matches the rest of the UI.
- Developer Dashboard no longer crashes when database stats arrive in the SQLite instrumentation shape instead of the legacy per-table counts shape.
- Extension uninstall now also prunes settings for providers contributed under `aiAgentProviders`, not just `aiProviders`, so the ghost-provider cleanup keeps working with the new contribution point. (follow-up to #446)

### Removed
<!-- Removed features go here -->

## [0.62.0] - 2026-05-26


### Added
- Non-markdown shared documents (Excalidraw, Mindmap, Mockup, etc.) now show the unified editor header bar with breadcrumb, View History, and local-source actions.
- Editor header bar's "Shared to Team" dropdown links to the shared document, showing its name with the team-side folder path in subscript.
- Shared documents have revision history: Cmd/Ctrl+S saves a named version, auto snapshots run after idle, and any past revision can be restored.
- Custom shared-document editors can publish history controllers so the global History dialog can route to collaborative revisions.
- Extensions SDK permissions and backend modules.
- Extension panels can run read-only SQL via `host.data.query()` against the local PGLite store when the manifest declares `nimbalyst-database-read`.
- Backend-module allowlist: only built-in extensions, curated marketplace ids, and dev-installed extensions with `NIMBALYST_ALLOW_DEV_BACKEND_MODULES=1` can ship native-code backends.

### Changed
- Auto-update downloads in the background and shows only the "Ready to install" toast; the redundant "Update Available" toast is removed. (#327)
- Extension docs now cover all four markdown/transcript contribution surfaces in both the internal architecture doc and the public SDK docs.
- Backend-module consent prompt leads with an explicit "this extension will run native code on your computer" banner; granular catalog ids only cover host-brokered services.

### Fixed
- Claude Code sessions break out of the SDK iterator after the `result` chunk so the binary's task-list reminder hook can't emit a 14+ minute `tool_result(Stream closed)` flood that pins sendMessage open.
- Claude Code sessions flip to "ready" the moment the model's turn finishes instead of sitting on the last output for up to 30 s while the SDK stdin grace period expired.
- Claude Code sessions no longer reset mid-conversation when the agent spawns sub-agents. (#451, #456, #457)
- CI `npm ci` no longer fails resolving `@nimbalyst/collab-adapters`; the workspace was missing from `package-lock.json`.
- Project quick open loads recent projects from stored recents instead of crawling every workspace on open.
- Rebuild Extensions submenu lists buildable extensions alphabetically.
- Shared Excalidraw and mockup tabs no longer come back blank after restart or close+reopen.
- Tracker list, table, and kanban views share the session-style `#tag` typeahead filter.
- Session history search bar no longer overlaps floating popovers (e.g. Claude Usage).
- Re-uploading a local source into a shared markdown document waits for the collab write to be acknowledged before tearing down the headless sync client.
- Codex session-naming reminder no longer leaks into the chat transcript. (#420)
- Mobile sync picks up Codex sessions running in git worktrees by resolving worktree workspaceIds to the parent project path. (#430) Thanks @stamkivi.
- Claude Code plugins installed at the project scope appear in the Installed plugins list with marketplace and scope badges.
- Slash-command typeahead lists commands and skills from Claude CLI plugins without requiring the experimental "Agent Workflows" toggle.
- Excalidraw "import mermaid" registers the rendered diagram image, so it no longer shows as a broken thumbnail. (#428)
- Codex sessions append actionable guidance when `~/.codex/config.toml` has a url-based MCP server the bundled Codex rejects, instead of an opaque failure. (#424)
- Dollar signs in markdown no longer collapse currency text like `$7M ... $40M` as inline LaTeX; the typing-time `$...$` shortcut is replaced by slash-menu "Math (inline)" / "Math (block)". (#447)
- Trackers panel refetches when switching projects in the sidebar rail instead of staying pinned to the workspace that was active at app startup. (#441)

### Removed
- Catalog permission ids `spawn-process`, `network-loopback`, `network-internet`, and `filesystem` are no longer accepted; they were unenforceable inside a Node backend. Manifests listing them load with a non-fatal warning.

## [0.61.1] - 2026-05-21


### Added
- AI action seed file now includes sibling-session launch examples for planning and worktree implementation.
- Tracker screen has a table view with sortable columns, resizable widths, and aligned headers.
- "Share to Team" opens a folder picker so you can choose the destination folder and rename the document before sharing; last-used folder is remembered per workspace.
- Shared documents can remember their local source file, surface re-upload actions, and relink missing local files.

### Changed
- Tracker row interactions unified in a shared hook; legacy `'table'` view-mode entries migrate to `'list'`.
- Agent guidance treats markdown links to custom-editor files as the default way to share visuals.

### Fixed
- Bug-report anonymizer scrubs workspace paths and Windows path-form variants. (#396)
- Imported sessions now show the model actually used instead of always Sonnet. (#394)
- CollabV3 no longer hammers the server with rejected connections on JWT/userId mismatch; backs off pre-open failures exponentially up to 5 minutes.
- Renderer no longer hangs during heavy tool-call streams when CollabV3 JWT/userId mismatch latch is set.
- Shared docs defer markdown bootstrap until server sync to avoid duplicated content; share-to-team preserves full custom-editor suffixes.
- Shared-document tabs respect Find and Close Tab menu commands; dev HMR no longer stacks stale reconnect listeners.
- Mobile git commit proposal cancellation sends a durable prompt response so blocked sessions actually cancel.
- iOS session sync preserves workstream, worktree, pin, and naming metadata so sessions don't reappear as duplicates.
- Floating menus use floating-ui portals so they stay visible instead of clipping inside panels.
- Agent transcript no longer repaints on every streamed token or keystroke; text selection in running sessions stays usable.
- Dev-mode transcript reprocess refreshes views without marking sessions unread; child session menus under workstreams unified.
- Settings Alpha badges show the shared tooltip with alpha risk details and future Team pricing.
- Codex app-server tool events now appear in transcripts.
- Renderer no longer hangs when opening large markdown files mid-AI-edit.
- External session edits excluded from git staging. (#398)

## [0.61.0] - 2026-05-21

- Shareable deep links for tracker items via "Copy Link" on the kanban, table, and detail header.
- Shareable deep links for team documents via "Copy Link" in the shared-document menu.
- Programmable actions can launch a new sibling session (per-action `launch` / `model` / `foreground` / `autoSubmit` config in `ai-actions.md`).

### Changed
- File-based plan trackers (`design/trackers/*.md`) unified with DB tracker items on the kanban.
- `nimbalyst-session-naming` MCP server set to `alwaysLoad` so `update_session_meta` stays in the prompt instead of behind ToolSearch.
- Triple-layered defenses against file-watcher attribution-queue overflows under multi-session codegen / build storms. (#352, #365)
- Stytch B2B auth recovery: honor JWT `exp`, log WS close codes, surface worker error params, centralize auth state, add iOS Sign Out.
- Cut ~970k/week of low-value PostHog events (file-save / file-conflict / streamed-response / update-poll dedup).
- System addendum nudges agents toward `PromptForUserInput` widget over chat-based questions.
- CLAUDE.md refactored into path-scoped `.claude/rules/` plus dedicated docs.

### Fixed
- Database lock dialog vs. false-positive lockout on fresh-timestamp / ambiguous locks; force-unlock path restored. (#272 follow-up)
- AI-edit review diff preserved in CSV and datamodel custom editors. (#328)
- Auto-update toast no longer fires on transient DNS failures during background polls. (#387)
- Tracker "Updated" widget renders every field change, not just the hardcoded set.
- Dragging files into AI input inserts `[name](/absolute/path)` markdown links instead of `@<relative-path>`.
- Shared tracker bodies now sync end-to-end through the collab Y.Doc, not just local cache.
- Pasted Google-Docs-style images stored as assets instead of inline base64.
- iOS Codex on app-server transport renders messages (was throwing in the SDK parser and silently dropping output).
- Transcript no longer rerenders on activity in unrelated sessions.
- AIService shutdown no longer dereferences `sessionManager` / `settingsStore` on late-arriving IPC during quit.
- Dead flat-list transcript code path removed; desktop and iOS now run VList unconditionally.
- E2E selectors unstuck (worktree, datamodellm, core specs).

## [0.60.6] - 2026-05-19

### Fixed
- Windows release build no longer fails `vite build` with `[postcss] Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'blocklist')`; tailwind config path now uses `fileURLToPath`.

## [0.60.5] - 2026-05-19

### Added
- LaTeX math editing in the Lexical document editor via a new built-in `math` extension; KaTeX inline (`$...$`) and block (`$$...$$`) with double-click edit.
- Programmable action prompts in the AI composer; per-workspace `nimbalyst-local/ai-actions.md` defines reusable prompt presets.
- Collaborative editing for extension custom editors via `useCollaborativeEditor` hook + `customEditors[].collaboration` manifest field (extension-sdk 0.2.0); Excalidraw and CSV opt in.
- MockupLM Share-to-Team collaborative editing for `.mockup.html` and `.mockupproject`.
- Tracker sync rewritten as metadata-layer `TrackerSyncEngine`: server-assigned monotonic `syncId`, hybrid conflict resolution, Y.Doc-CRDT bodies, encrypted envelopes.
- Install-from-GitHub prefers Release assets over cloning source; authors no longer need to commit `dist/`.
- `nimbalyst-settings` MCP server for in-app configuration (theme, sync, feature flags, extensions, tracker policies, workspaces) with allowlist + audit logging.
- Runtime contributions for transcript markdown and tool widgets; transcript math moves into the new `math` extension.

### Changed
- `@nimbalyst/collab-protocol` extracted as single source of truth for client<->server WebSocket wire types; `packages/collabv3` moved to a separate `nimbalyst-collab` project.
- `extension-sdk` 0.2.0 with the new collab editor API (backwards-compatible; no-ops on hosts without collaboration).
- Agent transcript returned to virtua with safer selection handling; wider desktop render buffer.
- Wakeup-resumed prompts no longer render in the user lane; new "Resumed from scheduled wakeup" system card. (#376)
- `getMcpConfigService` extracted into `mcpConfigServiceRef` so non-entry modules stop back-importing `main/index.ts`.

### Fixed
- Crash-on-load loop on markdown files with extremely wide table rows; `TABLE_TRANSFORMER` now skips rows above 5 KB and falls back to plain markdown. (#321)
- Tracker (kanban) tools now work from the agent; all 11 `tracker_*` tools added to `INTERNAL_MCP_TOOLS`. (#236)
- CSV editor currency / percent / number column formats render via RevoGrid `cellTemplate`. (#329)
- Claude usage indicator no longer hidden by a deprecated `navigator.platform` check on Windows / Linux. (#362)
- Marketplace clone-source path no longer bricks an existing GitHub install when the new clone is missing `dist/`.
- Manifest-only extensions (theme-only, `claudePlugin`-only) install from a GitHub URL. (#355, #356)
- Queued prompts no longer re-send on restart-after-AskUserQuestion, mid-turn cancel, or mobile-sync rollback. (NIM-615)
- Lightning button reliably interrupts and drains the queue. (#337)
- Unsaved tab edits survive file renames. (#367)
- CSV and datamodel shared documents survive close-and-reopen.
- In-app issue flow uses the correct `.yml` template, drops bogus labels, and prefills the right field.
- Codex interactive prompt correlation stabilized; new thread IDs persisted before interactive prompts can block.
- B2B auth callback fails fast when Stytch returns no session instead of building a broken deep link. (#351, NIM-600)
- Alpha updates no longer 404 on stray non-`v0.*` tags landing in the `releases.atom` feed.
- Mac local builds unblocked; renderer / extension build-time warning noise reduced.

## [0.60.4] - 2026-05-16

### Changed
- Tracker schema watcher test rewritten to use mocked chokidar callbacks instead of real filesystem timing.

### Fixed
- Agent transcript regressions from v0.60.3's flat-list switch: drag-selection lands correctly, short transcripts hug the input, sticky-bottom no longer drops on streaming or lazy-mount.

## [0.60.3] - 2026-05-15

### Added
- Filter the sessions list by tag with a `#` picker that composes with title search. (#244)
- In-app ChatGPT / API-key sign-in for OpenAI Codex via the app-server transport; pre-flight auth gate with a "Sign in to OpenAI Codex" CTA.
- URL fields for tracker items and PR metadata in the tracker schema.
- Compact Rename and Move buttons in the project header. (Refs #305)

### Changed
- Agent session transcript switched to a flat `content-visibility:auto` list on non-iOS so DOM node identity (and selection) survive scrolling.

### Fixed
- CSV editor no longer truncates `YYYY-MM-DD` date cells to the year via `parseFloat`. (#329)
- Claude Code permission stream no longer dies on sessions with many accumulated tracker tasks; `PROMPT_GRACE_MS` bumped from 5s to 30s. (#320)
- Enter at end of a list item ending with inline-code-plus-space no longer keeps the new bullet in inline-code format. (#302)
- "+" (Create new...) button in the session sidebar now works when all sessions are archived. (#306)
- Cmd+O Quick Open and @-mention picker scope "recent files" to the current workspace. (#301, #304)
- Find-in-page search bar no longer hides behind the session-phase pill on narrow widths. (#309)
- Long multi-line git errors stay a single line with View / Copy buttons via a new shared `GitStatusBar`.

- Codex pasted images unblocked in app-server turns (camelCase `localImage`).
- Codex helper PATH preserved in app-server mode for packaged Windows builds.
- Codex `developer_git_commit_proposal` no longer produces duplicate "Changes Committed" cards across SDK / app-server transports.
- Codex bottom-left usage indicator no longer sticks at a stale percentage after the 5h / 7d window resets. (#120)
- "Thinking…" indicator no longer pins after Claude Code finishes on sessions where the workspacePath isn't yet known. (#116)
- PGLite lock self-heals on Windows after PID reuse (60s grace window inside the EPERM branch). (#272)
- Quick Open and @-mention picker no longer flash stale hover state when opened via keyboard.
- Agent session history list now has stable ordering.
- Collab v3 JWT-mismatch warning is now actionable: decodes claims, names the consequence, points at the file to look at.
- PGLite worker `init` allows 120s (was 30s) so the first relaunch after a force-close doesn't fail while WAL recovery is in progress. (#238)

## [0.60.2] - 2026-05-15

### Added
- Codex moved to the app-server transport for proper file-edit hooks and unified-diff capture; one codex child per session, cached across turns.
- `inheritModel` flag on `spawn_session` MCP tool so `/launch-new-session` can keep the new session on the caller's model.
- LaTeX math rendering in agent transcript markdown via remark-math / rehype-katex / katex. (#136)
- Inline embeds for extension-edited files (Excalidraw, mockup, datamodel, csv, sqlite) inside markdown documents.
- Unified embedded editor breadcrumbs to match the main editor toolbar.
- Extension manifest gains `supportsTranscriptEmbed` / `transcriptEmbedHeight`; MockupLM, DatamodelLM, and CSV Spreadsheet opt in.
- Clear-all-unread action in the system tray.
- Workstream tag row collapses overflow tags into a "+N" pill that opens a floating menu.
- Human-readable widget for upstream Claude API 5xx errors with the `request_id`. (#277)

### Changed
- Codex session sync bandwidth reduced via per-block 8 KB truncation before encryption; per-session 50 MB cap with FIFO eviction; `SessionRoom` TTL dropped 30 -> 14 days.
- `MessageStreamingHandler` tracks per-listener refs instead of `removeAllListeners` so other subscribers aren't dropped. (#225)

### Fixed
- Pre-approved tools in the global Claude allow list now bypass the permission dialog; new `matchesAllowPattern` handles MCP server-wide / bare-name / `Bash(...)` wildcards. (#152)
- CommonMark angle-bracket inline links (`[text](<url>)`) render as clickable hyperlinks. (#86)
- OpenCode test-connection finds the `opencode` binary under nvm / asdf / Volta / fnm. (#184)
- Large pasted-text attachments use the platform tmpdir on Windows instead of hardcoded `/tmp`. (#269)
- Chat-attached text files reach the agent instead of degrading to a `@filename` token. (#239)
- "Allow this tool?" permission dialog no longer gets stuck with no buttons. (#276)
- Right-click Archive surfaces backend rejections in a visible error notification instead of failing silently. (#282)
- Meta-agent `get_session_result` returns the actual most-recent assistant response on Codex follow-up turns. (#270)
- Pressing Enter at end of a tracker-item line on the last line of the file inserts a new paragraph instead of swallowing the keypress. (#263)
- OpenCode model picker finds `opencode.json` on Windows (`%APPDATA%\opencode\opencode.json`). (#284)
- Codex usage indicator no longer sits on a stale percentage after the 5h / 7d window resets. (#120)
- PGLite lock self-heals on Windows after PID reuse (60s grace window in the EPERM branch). (#272)
- "Thinking..." indicator no longer pins on extended-thinking Opus sessions where the workspacePath isn't yet known. (#116)
- Auto-update on macOS no longer fails with "command is disabled" after download; redundant pre-download `checkForUpdates()` removed so Squirrel.Mac proxy stays alive. (#245)
- Codex `thread/resume` re-forwards `mcp_servers`, `sandbox`, `approvalPolicy`, `developerInstructions`, `model`, and reasoning effort.
- Codex interactive widgets (`developer_git_commit_proposal`, `AskUserQuestion`) no longer deadlock; `tool_call_started` now fires on `item/started`.
- Claude sessions preserved across project moves via shared workspace path encoding.
- Blank-turn rendering for unknown slash commands fixed; result-text backfill bypasses the dedup gates when `num_turns` is 0.
- Codex chat attachments preserved in prompts and transcript across SDK and ACP sessions.
- Onboarding mode-picker no longer beach-balls on cold start; redundant dynamic imports converted to static; `onboarding:get` races a 3s timeout. (#260)
- Archived workstream children and archived worktrees stay out of session lists / history.
- Git commit failures surface instead of reporting fake success; pre-commit hook stderr preserved. (#202)
- Copilot ACP retains context between turns; "Session is already loaded" treated as success. (#251)
- Wrap toggle in transcript code blocks persists across `OverflowWrapper` remounts. (#274)
- Detached HEAD state handled in the git extension; pull/push disabled while detached.
- Git views refresh after `.gitignore` edits (root and nested).
- Session archive state propagates to iOS via the CollabV3 `metadata_updated` cache merge.
- `claude-code` no longer shadows OAuth login with empty `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`.
- Copilot CLI resolves from `%APPDATA%\npm` on packaged Windows.
- Finder/Dock drag-and-drop into folders restored on Electron 32 via `webUtils.getPathForFile`. (#206)
- Finder drops on empty file-tree space copy into the workspace root. (NIM-584)
- Collab v3 Share-to-Team migrates pasted-image asset refs to `collab-asset://` URIs via a pre-seed pass.
- Collab v3 session titles encrypted to `encryptedTitle` / `titleIv` in `SessionRoom`; server strips plaintext title.

## [0.60.1] - 2026-05-12

### Added
- `chatShowToolCalls` user-facing setting (default `true`) to hide tool-call rows entirely in the AI chat; `showToolCalls` stays a developer-mode toggle. (#118)
- Editor extension API: extensions can ship Lexical extensions via `contributions.lexicalExtensions` + `module.lexicalExtensions`; editor shell switched to `LexicalExtensionComposer`; built-ins (Mermaid, Images, Kanban, Diff, Table, etc.) declared as LexicalExtensions; legacy `PluginPackage` / `PluginRegistry` retired.

### Changed
- Upgrade Lexical and `@lexical/*` to 0.44.0 across the runtime; stop forking `@lexical/markdown`'s importer (NCRs in place of backslash escapes); `LexicalMarkdownImport.ts` and forked text transformers deleted.
- Cut per-commit GitHub Actions runtime: macOS sim job gated to `packages/ios/**`, new Ubuntu Transcript Bundle job, `node_modules` and `packages/runtime/dist` caches.

### Fixed
- Markdown anchor links scroll to in-document headings via new headless `HeadingAnchorExtension` (GitHub-style slug ids). (#248)
- Marketplace install from a GitHub URL surfaces a clear error when the repo has no built `dist/` directory and cleans up the partial install. (#247)
- Commit-widget failure path renders the error state with the underlying error string instead of collapsing to "cancelled". (Partial fix for #202)
- Commit-widget proposal renders before the SDK chunk flush; `interactiveToolHandlers` writes an awaited synthetic `nimbalyst_tool_use` row keyed by the SDK toolUseId. (#265)
- Restore open workspaces after an auto-update relaunch (save session state before tearing listeners down). (#232)
- Workspace YAML tracker schemas load on every workspace-open path (session restore, UI open, file-open create), not just CLI-arg open.
- Agent-mode conflict dialogs no longer overflow short viewports; body scrolls, max-width widens.
- Triple-nested emphasis no longer corrupts on export when a whitespace-only text node sits between formatted siblings.
- Lexical collaboration context restored for Lexical 0.44 (upstream removed the implicit global context).
- In-tree `SelectionAlwaysOnDisplayPlugin` checked in; cold-clone / CI builds no longer fail with a missing-module error.
- Dark-mode logo asset rendered correctly in the editor shell after the Lexical upgrade.

## [0.60.0] - 2026-05-11

### Added
- Multi-project rail with keep-warm switching: opt-in Discord-style vertical rail lets one window host multiple workspace projects with `Cmd/Ctrl+1..9` switching; AI sessions, file watchers, tabs, and git status stay live in inactive projects. Refs #155.
- Streamlined feedback intake: `/feedback:bug-report` and `/feedback:feature-request` route through a single `FeedbackIntakeDialog` that prefills the GitHub issue.
- Orphan Durable Object cleanup endpoint and driver in collabv3; gated by Cloudflare Access (`Cf-Access-Jwt-Assertion`), no shared-bearer fallback.

### Fixed
- Workstream rows no longer get created inside worktrees (the worktree IS the workstream); one-time migration deletes accidental three-layer hierarchies. New `docs/SESSION_HIERARCHY.md`.
- Worktree child sessions stay in sync with the parent workspace; running / waiting indicators restored. (#231)
- Codex `workspace-write` sandbox can reach sibling worktrees via `additionalDirectories` (`OpenAICodexProvider.setAdditionalDirectoriesLoader`). (#230)
- `spawn_session` inherits the caller's worktree instead of creating the child in the project root. (#229, refs #37)
- Diff peek paths resolve against the worktree's own checkout for worktree files.
- Slash skills namespaced consistently with commands (`/excalidraw:excalidraw`, `/planning:design`, ...); `nimbalyst-` prefix dropped from bundled plugin names. (#234)
- Codex command instructions preserved when frontmatter is missing a description.
- `FeedbackIntakeDialog` `onLaunch` typed via `FeedbackIntakeLaunchOptions`.
- Commit proposal widget sorts files alphabetically by basename and subdirectories by displayPath. (#233)
- Open file links of the form `/abs/path/<real absolute path>` resolve on Windows and macOS. (#240)

## [0.59.4] - 2026-05-09

### Added
- New `PromptForUserInput` MCP tool: single structured-prompt widget with five field types (`multiSelect`, `singleSelect`, `reorder`, `editText`, `confirm`) so one prompt collects several inputs at once.
- `mcp__nimbalyst-tracker__tracker_update` can change a tracker item's `primaryType`; activity log records the change. (#79)
- Title-only mode (`searchField: 'title'`) for `list_recent_sessions` MCP tool. (#83)
- Allow renaming AI sessions; "Preferred Agent Language" global setting steers AI-generated session names. (#219)
- Voice agent can run "Commit with AI" via a new `propose_commit` voice tool; voice now reads the actual commit title and file count.
- Voice Mode settings panel surfaces microphone permission status with a deep link to macOS System Settings.
- Voice mode "Generate Project Summary" no longer requires an Anthropic API key; launches a new agent session in the configured agent. (#201)
- Codex slash command autocomplete: workspace Codex skills surface in the shared slash-command picker.
- Skills and commands compatibility layer for Claude Code and Codex; extension manifest gains `agentWorkflows` contributions.
- Map Codex reasoning items into transcript thinking blocks.
- MCP servers configured with `command: "node"` use Electron's bundled Node runtime, so MCP works without system Node. (Refs #197)

### Changed
- `[StartupSlow] {name} took {ms}ms` log when a startup phase crosses 2s (PGLite init, ProjectFileSync, SyncManager fetch, TrackerSync initial sync).
- Upgrade bundled Codex SDK and harden Claude packaged binary resolution (reject unusable `app.asar` paths).

### Fixed
- Legacy plan and decision tracker docs (top-level `planStatus` / `decisionStatus`) appear on the Tracker board again.
- Drag-and-drop on a multi-file selection moves or copies every selected item, not just one. (#31)
- Claude Chat Test Connection works against the default `claude-opus-4-7` model; `temperature` omitted for Opus 4.7+. (#199)
- `automationStatus` documents (created via `/automation`) appear as Tracker rows. (#67)
- Detect frontmatter on Windows files with CRLF line endings; all 13 frontmatter regex sites use `\r?\n`. (#68)
- Show the tray icon on Linux and Windows; macOS-only theme subscription guarded. (#39)
- User-visible error dialog when deleting a file from the workspace tree fails. (#195)
- `ErrorDialog` `details` prop accepts a plain string in addition to the structured `DiffErrorDetails` shape. (#216)
- Stop spamming `Update Error: net::ERR_NAME_NOT_RESOLVED` on the auto-update background poll; network errors during hourly check suppressed. (#56)
- `Ctrl+=`, `Shift+=`, and numpad `+/-` accelerators all zoom on Windows / Linux. (#205, #220)
- Honor `.gitignore` from nested git repos when watching a non-git workspace root; no more OOM on huge build-output trees. (#207)
- Files committed inside a nested git repo no longer report as untracked indefinitely. (#122)
- `customClaudeCodePath` read from the `ai-settings` store instead of `app-settings.json`. (#162)
- Drag-drop session merge initializes workstream state via `convertToWorkstreamAtom` (`skipSiblingCreation: true` path was skipping it). (#212)
- Live-update sub-session renames and add Rename to the workstream parent menu. (#211)
- Tracker "+ Launch Session" uses the workspace's default provider instead of hardcoded `claude-code`. (#176)
- Skip the hidden-editor mount for built-in file types in extension AI tool dispatch. (#217)
- Hide the Environment Variables section from the Project tab in Settings (it's a global file). (#185)
- Git extension panel persists active tab and selected commit (by hash) per workspace.
- Git extension Output log persists across panel close/open via a module-level `useSyncExternalStore`.
- Session list refresh no longer stampedes PGLite; `getSessionsForUncommittedFiles` filters by uncommitted paths and dedups in-flight promises.
- Shared Documents recover after laptop sleep/wake; reconnect path always tears down and reestablishes the WebSocket.
- Read-only Codex bash commands (`sed -n`, `nl`, `cat`) no longer attribute as edits; pre-edit snapshot captured at `item.started`. (NIM-475)
- Paste-as-Text shortcut reliable and visible in the keyboard shortcuts dialog.
- Voice mic stays open after the agent finishes a turn (15s listen window starts when audio playback drains).
- Bold spans containing inline code stay intact through approve-all diff round-trips.
- Shared mockup viewer rendering restored; mockup diff review re-enabled for `.mockup.html` editors.

### Removed
- Unused `MCPConfigBuilder` removed from runtime.

## [0.59.2] - 2026-05-07

### Changed
- Finish IPC listener centralization and lock it in via an eslint `no-restricted-syntax` rule banning `electronAPI.on()` outside `store/listeners` (with documented carve-outs). Last component-level callsites migrated.

### Fixed
- Codex `file_change` edits render as proper red/green diffs (not empty-baseline whole-file-green) for gitignored / never-snapshotted / post-boot-created files; `pre_edit_snapshot` StreamChunk captures the baseline at `item.started`.
- Markdown export to PDF includes the document title in metadata and generates outlines / tagged PDFs from headings.
- Open file tabs no longer disappear when switching tasks / sessions; `WorkstreamEditorTabs` restore effect waits on `workstreamStatesLoadedAtom`. (#169)
- Settings -> Claude Agent SDK panel reads the version correctly when `@anthropic-ai/claude-agent-sdk` is hoisted to the repo-root `node_modules`. (#60)

## [0.59.1] - 2026-05-06

### Added
- Codex `file_change` tool calls render as inline red/green edit cards in the transcript; new `nimtc|...` synthetic edit-group IDs and `CodexEditWindowRegistry` attribute writes without upstream hooks.
- Privileged `collab-asset://` scheme for E2E-encrypted attachments in collaborative documents; main fetches and decrypts asset bytes so CORS isn't in the renderer's path.
- Voice agent gets a `create_session` MCP tool to spin up a coding session on demand and link it as the active session.
- Delayed finish timestamp on completed transcript turn summaries (with prior-day dates).
- Tracker MCP tools expose schema introspection (`tracker_define_type` schema fields). (NIM-371)
- New `tracker_unlink_session` MCP tool.
- Existing-session tracker link flow: choose an existing session when linking a tracker item.

### Changed
- Upgrade bundled `@openai/codex-sdk` to 0.128.0 (via 0.124.0).
- Refine collabv3 metrics dashboard queries (`blob2` = DO id, `cpuTime` for DO compute, `durableObjectsSqlStorageGroups` for SQLite size, `responseBodySize` for subrequests).
- Restore optional email collection in analytics (onboarding / Stytch sign-in deliberately set it).
- Local-to-shared tracker upgrades require explicit confirmation. (NIM-364)
- `tracker_create` no longer auto-links the calling AI session; pass `linkSession: true` to link. (NIM-408)
- `tracker_link_session` MCP tool accepts an optional explicit `sessionId` arg with validation. (NIM-405)

### Fixed
- Default `CLAUDE_CODE_ENTRYPOINT` to `'cli'` so OAuth subscription traffic isn't deprioritized as third-party. (#174)
- Open a workspace with a zero-commit `.git` repo without spamming a stack trace into `main.log`.
- Refresh the editor on AI edits when the pre-edit IPC outruns the disk write (skip empty-diff session creation).
- Sub-bullet-with-link diffs render cleanly; tree-matcher dedup, URL wrapping on the target, reversed removals.
- Codex edit attribution stable: synthetic edit-group IDs reused in raw tool matching, watcher fallback delayed.
- Tracker session link visibility centralized through shared rules so MCP handlers behave the same as the UI.
- Meta-agent session history actions restored: context menus on meta-agent rows, archive and delete scoped to the full group.
- Collabv3 analytics tracks the real `sessionId` (DO id as `blob2`) instead of empty string.
- Auto-committed widgets stay visually committed when the auto-commit toggle flips off; success widget gains a proper "Disable auto-approve" checkbox.
- Shared tracker session links stay local-only (don't leak per-user links to team members). (NIM-368)
- Tracker session linking UI initializes on first load. (NIM-407)
- Meta-agent MCP tools restored for Codex sessions via the Codex SDK allowlist.
- `ai:messages-logged-batch` routed only to the window owning the session's workspace; stops cross-window "Rejecting session" warnings.
- Local tracker typing preserved during MCP refresh races.
- `@` mentions for `nimbalyst-local` plans surface in the mention picker again.
- MCP `tracker_update` no longer clobbers collab Y.Doc bodies for shared trackers; skipped writes reported back via `structured.skippedFields`. (NIM-436)
- Tracker reads / writes no longer corrupt `automationStatus` (nested block wins on overlap; caller updates route to top-level for un-owned fields). (NIM-324)
- Claude Code `[^a-zA-Z0-9]` path encoder applied to the importer so workspace paths with spaces / apostrophes resolve; `claude-code:sync-sessions` surfaces failures. (#170)
- Persisted `fieldUpdatedAt` threaded through tracker upload so batch / recovery uploads don't claim all fields were just edited. (NIM-246)
- Tracker detail editor refreshes on external content updates via a key-epoch remount. (NIM-433)
- Meta-agent `get_session_result` extracts Codex child output (event_msg, item.completed for agent_message + reasoning, task_complete). (#145)

### Removed
- Obsolete `AssetLinkPlugin` (superseded by `CollabAssetLinkPlugin`).

## [0.59.0] - 2026-05-05

### Added
- Peek file diffs from the git log commit detail panel: click a file to pin its unified diff in the existing peek popover; Up/Down steps, Esc closes.

### Changed
- Migrate alpha auto-updates from the legacy R2 feed to GitHub prereleases; adds cumulative public-release promotion commands.
- Centralize PGLite TIMESTAMPTZ handling to epoch-ms via `toMillis`. (#147)

### Fixed
- Workspace-filtered Claude session import resolves paths with spaces / apostrophes / accents via a shared `encodeWorkspaceDir()` helper matching upstream `[^a-zA-Z0-9]`.
- Parent's `childCount` bumps in the session registry when a child is added so the left-pane workstream tree reveals new children without a manual toggle. (NIM-435)
- `ai_agent_messages` writes coalesced through a single FIFO `AgentMessageWriteQueue` (200ms idle / 200-row batch); writer-lock p95 ~330ms -> ~1ms, unblocking `can_use_tool` audits. (#163, NIM-340 / NIM-431)
- Word-level inline diff no longer interleaves red/green fragments on near-complete paragraph rewrites; block-level fallback above 5 clusters, sentence-level pre-pass peels identical openers / closers.
- MCP `workspaceId` normalized for worktree callers at the meta-agent dispatch boundary so `spawn_session` doesn't fail with "Parent session not found in this workspace". (#157)
- Wide walkthrough callouts (`step.wide`) clamp to 420px to match the Tailwind rendered width. (Refs #148, #164)
- Claude session import falls back to all sessions when the workspace-filtered scan returns nothing, with a notice that scope was broadened.
- PGLite WAL growth managed: explicit CHECKPOINT after init / before close, periodic maintenance CHECKPOINT above 200 MB, `db.close()` timeout 2s -> 5s, WAL stats on the Database dashboard.
- Single-flight `refreshSession()` (and per-`personalOrgId` keyed variant) so cold-start no longer fires 4+ concurrent `/auth/refresh` requests racing for Stytch's single-use token. (NIM-430)
- Claude Code stdin stays open across late tool permission requests via a persistent `AsyncIterable` prompt and a `PromptStreamController` with 5s grace timer. (#160, NIM-340)
- Later-turn Codex tool calls render on iOS transcripts; dedup on `(id, toolName)` so reused per-turn item ids don't drop; `openai-codex-acp` and `copilot-cli` routed through their own mobile parsers.
- Git commit proposals stage deletes via `git add --all -- <paths>` (mobile, desktop, auto-commit paths). (NIM-428)
- Child `session:completed` only forwards to parent on terminal idle; between-turn idles suppressed by pending-queue check; signature dedup resets on `session:started` / `session:streaming`. (#142)
- Keyboard shortcuts render platform-correct glyphs on Windows / Linux via an `isMac` parameter; three hardcoded `⌘⇧X` literals replaced with helper calls. (#149)
- HEIC wasm decoder lazy-loaded so standard PNG / JPEG attachments don't pay the startup cost.

## [0.58.21] - 2026-05-04

### Changed
- CI: re-enable tag-triggered electron release builds (post-OSS-launch tag force-push finished); `/release` no longer needs a separate `gh workflow run` dispatch.

### Fixed
- Pasting images into markdown on Windows no longer fails with a `nim-asset` 403 (split on both separators, explicit `..`-segment traversal guard).
- "Stream closed" tool permission errors on multi-result Claude Code turns reduced via a 5s reset-on-activity grace timer.
- Restoring from history on a gitignored markdown file no longer leaves the editor showing stale content. (NIM-426)

## [0.58.20] - 2026-05-04

### Changed
- Bump claude-agent-sdk 0.2.117 -> 0.2.126 (MCP reconnection after transport abort, `SessionStore.append()` retry, `origin` field on result messages).

### Fixed
- Local images render after 0.58.19's `webSecurity: true` hardening; runtime `localAssetUrl` helper routes absolute paths through `nim-asset://`. (#146)

## [0.58.19] - 2026-05-04

### Fixed
- Harden Electron security: per-launch bearer token on the five internal MCP HTTP servers; drop `Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *` from MCP preflight; restore `webSecurity: true` via a registered `nim-asset://` custom protocol with an open-workspace allowlist. (#146)
- Invisible git log resize handle in the git extension.

## [0.58.18] - 2026-05-03


### Added
- Live-update kanban peek transcript while session is running so the AI transcript streams in real time without waiting for the turn to complete.
- Clear button on session history search input for quick filter resets.
- CollabV3 sync metrics dashboard for monitoring sync health and performance.

### Changed
- Update lodash-es for CVE fix.
- Reduce collabv3 observability sampling to 5%.
- Require workspacePath for Claude Code path loader, tightening the contract so workspace-scoped overrides resolve correctly.

### Fixed
- Route built-in editor saves through Layer D and sync diff resolution across sibling tabs so edits in one tab no longer silently overwrite concurrent changes in another.
- Smooth iOS session back navigation so the transition no longer stutters.
- Keep iOS transcript live during AI turns instead of freezing until the turn completes.
- Add settings shortcut to voice mode errors so users can quickly configure their provider when voice fails.
- Prevent autosave from overwriting AI-recreated deleted files by checking the recently-deleted set before writing.
- Use getTime() for TIMESTAMPTZ store timestamps so date comparisons work correctly across timezones (#140).

## [0.58.17] - 2026-05-01

### Added
- Auto-name Claude Code sessions via an SDK side-question on the first turn: two parallel SDK control requests set the title (~1s) and tags / phase early, with `phase: "planning"` fallback so every session lands on the kanban.
- `xhigh` effort level option in the Effort Level selector. (#133, closes #132)

### Changed
- Rename `spawn_sibling` MCP tool to `spawn_session` and add an `isolated` parameter for top-level fix-and-commit sessions; `/launch-new-session` picks the mode from the user's phrasing.
- Consolidate AI provider override normalization (`normalizeAIProviderOverrides` exported and reused in `AIService`). Follow-up to #128.
- Quiet noisy release-path logging in startup and document-service traces.

### Fixed
- Paste attachments now reach OpenCode (document text part + image / PDF `FilePart` with base64 data URL) instead of degrading to a phantom `@filename`. (#121)
- Codex ACP stderr buffer bounded to a 64 KB rolling tail to prevent main-process OOM after multi-hour sessions. (#119)
- Eliminate 15s waits on git status reads: pass `core.optionalLocks=false` and drop the `gitOperationLock` wrapper from read-only handlers.
- File tree refreshes when the agent creates a gitignored folder; workspace-tree watcher opts in to `add` / `unlink` events for gitignored paths. (#127)
- Worktree inherits the parent project's Claude path override.
- "Custom Claude Installation" override scoped per workspace via the existing override infrastructure (was leaking across projects). (#125, #128)
- Duplicate rows in `FilesEditedSidebar` tree collapsed; `SessionFileTracker.trackSingleFile` normalizes to absolute paths.

## [0.58.16] - 2026-05-01

### Added
- Agents can spawn sibling sessions via `/launch-new-session`; auto-promotes caller into a workstream with shared files/tabs/overview.
- Extensions can contribute themes via `contributions.themes`; manifest-only theme extensions supported with fallback to dark/light when disabled.
- Import Claude Code 2.1.x sessions via the File menu (no longer dev-mode-gated); correctly imports threaded prompts, subagents, persisted outputs, and extended-thinking blocks.

### Fixed
- Stop renderer freeze and OOM on long Claude Code streams; transcript now re-renders at most once per frame via `requestAnimationFrame` coalescing. (NIM-411)
- `spawn_sibling` now refreshes workstream UI without a manual toggle.
- Stop `HooklessAgentFileWatcher` warn-flood on Bash directory args; filter out directories from the path extractor.
- Reduce debug logging volume across services.

### Changed
- `@nimbalyst/extension-sdk` published as 0.1.5 with org rename alignment and npm Trusted Publishing (OIDC provenance).
- Correct iOS 1.1.0 changelog entries.

## [0.58.15] - 2026-04-30


### Added
- Full undo/redo for AI chat input (Cmd+Z/Cmd+Shift+Z) restoring text, attachments, and cursor position.
- Diff peek in AgentMode Files Edited sidebar: hover to reveal an inline unified-diff popover.
- File history dialog (Cmd+Y) works in agent mode.
- Surface archived sessions in `list_recent_sessions` MCP tool via new `includeArchived` parameter.
- `/social-response` slash command for drafting copy-paste-ready replies to user messages on Discord, GitHub, Twitter, etc.

### Changed
- Onboarding telemetry replaced with custom `onboarding_completed` PostHog event; fixed `user_role` property overwrite bug for 'Other' text.
- Coalesce streaming `assistant_message` chunks so Codex-ACP sessions don't persist one row per token; kanban peek tail bumped to 100.
- Bump `@nimbalyst/extension-sdk` to 0.1.1 and switch publish to npm Trusted Publishing (OIDC).
- CI: bump Node to 22 across workflows; raise the nested-lists diff test timeout to 20s.

### Fixed
- Keep AI diffs granular: LCS-based `diffWordsWithSpace` replaces prefix/suffix diff; in-flight edit races queued instead of dropped.
- Show row add/remove and in-cell content diffs in tables; LCS-based row alignment and visual diff for modified cells.
- Custom editors load for 3+ segment compound extensions (e.g. `*.reddit.watch.json`); use longest-suffix key match. (NIM-396)
- Resolve workspace-relative paths in `workspace:open-file` IPC.
- Track every file in a Codex ACP multi-file `apply_patch`.
- Stop context menus from flashing before positioning.
- Render OpenAI Codex icon for ACP transport in pickers.
- Render provider icons correctly in diff headers.
- Show child transcript in workstream/worktree kanban peek when the parent has no transcript of its own.
- Refresh kanban transcript peek on new events; cache now invalidates on `transcript:event`.
- Update opencode installation command to use `opencode-ai`.
- Reduce debug logging volume in DocumentSync.

### Removed
- Dead `DiffApprovalBar` plugin files removed (superseded by `UnifiedDiffHeader`).

## [0.58.14] - 2026-04-29


### Changed
- Final Stravu -> Nimbalyst rename: components, CSS class, path aliases, localStorage keys, and log paths aligned to `nimbalyst`.
- OSS prep: public repo assets, community health files (CONTRIBUTING.md, CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md, SECURITY.md), AGPL-3.0 on collabv3, gitignore generated outputs.
- GitHub Release promotion is now opt-in; tag pushes upload to R2 alpha channel only.
- Loud warning in extension SDK manifest reference: `supportsDiffMode` defaults to `false` and must be explicitly set to `true`.
- iOS: stop committing built `transcript-dist` and `editor-dist` bundles; Xcode pre-build script regenerates them.

### Fixed
- Restore inline screenshot preview in the agent transcript; `EditorScreenshotWidget` now parses `tool.result` via `parseToolResult()` instead of treating it as a structured object.
- Windows update download: retry on `EPERM`/`EBUSY` rename from antivirus-locked installer.
- ScheduleWakeup logic moved to a main-process static handler so vitest no longer crashes on Electron-only imports.

### Removed
- Unused `PostHogSurvey` component removed.

<!--
NOTE: v0.58.13 was tagged but never shipped to R2 -- the release build hit a
403 (Resource not accessible by integration) at electron-builder's GitHub
publish step because CI ran on nimbalyst-code with a token that can't write
to nimbalyst/nimbalyst. The "Make GitHub Release promotion opt-in" change
above (--publish never) is the fix; v0.58.14 bundles all of v0.58.13's
intended changes plus that fix.
-->


## [0.58.12] - 2026-04-29


### Fixed
- Fire `ScheduleWakeup` tool calls in Claude Code sessions by intercepting them in the `tool_use` stream.
- Spawn-safe paths for codex-acp and Copilot in packaged builds; rewrite `app.asar` to `app.asar.unpacked` and unify PATH detection via `enhancedPathLoader`.
- Cast `onerror` on MCP `Server` instances to satisfy `exactOptionalPropertyTypes` in ES2024 tsc.
- Bump CI mac runner runtime build heap to 8GB to fix OOM during `vite build`.

## [0.58.10] - 2026-04-28


### Added
- Recent file masks history in the git Changes tab (up to 10, deduped, dropdown picker).
- Guided agent bug-report flow (`FeedbackIntakeDialog`) replaces the PostHog feedback survey; Help > Send Feedback spawns a Claude Code session with anonymization and GitHub Issues posting.

### Changed
- `POSTHOG_EVENTS.md` and `FEATURE_INVENTORY.md` updated to reflect the new feedback flow.

### Fixed
- Ship `@opencode-ai/sdk` in packaged builds; add `validate-packaged-sdks` afterPack validator that tests real ESM imports from the packaged tree.
- Use latest session title in blocked-state OS notifications; fetch from repository at notify time instead of closing over stale reference.
- Pass platform/arch from electron-builder context to the packaged-SDK validator; no silent host-arch fallback.
- Install codex-acp cross-arch binary for Mac x64 builds; add `@zed-industries/codex-acp-darwin-${arch}` to `mac.extraResources`.
- Make the packaged-SDK validator work on Windows: use `pathToFileURL()` for prefix matching and `'junction'` for symlinks.

## [0.58.6] - 2026-04-28


### Added
- OpenCode provider: configurable models, LM Studio bridge, disable-auto-update toggle, and real error messages surfaced from `session.error`.
- Extension SDK declares app compatibility via `nimbalyst.minAppVersion`.

### Changed
- OSS prep: MIT license at root, AGPL-3.0 on collabv3, new `LICENSING.md`, Telemetry section in README.
- OSS prep: gitignore `nimbalyst-local/` and other local-only paths; untrack 67 previously-committed files.
- Loud warning in `TranscriptTransformer.CURRENT_VERSION` to never bump it for parser bugfixes.

### Fixed
- Keep AI red/green diff on open files; fix two races where `onFileChanged` could clobber the editor during diff apply or duplicate the same tag twice.
- Ship codex-acp native binary in packaged builds via `asarUnpack` and `build.files` wildcard. (NIM-388)

## [0.58.5] - 2026-04-28


### Added
- OpenAI Codex over ACP transport (alpha): `openai-codex-acp` provider via `@zed-industries/codex-acp` with native file-edit hooks, MCP passthrough, and `apply_patch` diff rendering.
- AI editing of shared collaborative documents via Yjs; new `readCollabDoc` and `applyCollabDocEdit` MCP tools using `collab://` URIs.
- Diff peek in the git commit proposal widget; shared `DiffPeekPopover` with the git extension, user-resizable with persisted size.
- Self-pacing session wakeups via `schedule_wakeup` MCP tool; persistent across restarts with OS notification on fire.
- Publish `@nimbalyst/extension-sdk` to npm on `extension-sdk-v*` tag push with npm provenance.

### Changed
- Consolidated tracker UI: `TrackerBottomPanel` removed, `TrackerMode` is now the single canonical tracker UI. (NIM-382)
- Alpha features open to all users; each is opt-in from its natural settings panel with an alpha badge. (NIM-380)
- Consolidated extensions Installed view into Settings > Extensions; Marketplace shows Discover only.
- Finish Tailwind migration: replace remaining `--surface-*`/`--text-*`/`--primary-color` CSS vars with `--nim-*` equivalents; drop backwards-compat aliases.
- Centralized renderer IPC listeners in `store/listeners/*`; components now read Jotai atoms instead of subscribing directly.
- Split `AIService.ts` into `aiServiceUtils.ts` (pure helpers) and `MessageStreamingHandler.ts` (send-message lifecycle).
- Extract `HooklessAgentFileWatcher` from `AIService` into its own class; add 100-test vitest suite for `aiServiceUtils`.

### Fixed
- Codex ACP `apply_patch` edits produce accurate `FilesEditedSidebar` entries and diff previews; force empty baseline for new-file adds.
- `@@` session typeahead shows real provider icons and phase badges matching the session list.
- Persist `FileGutter` collapsed state across remounts.
- Stabilize terminal bottom-panel restore across reloads.
- Remove blank space below the Claude Code Plugins panel.
- Render Monaco diff gutter glyphs correctly; fix codicon font 403 and restyle gutter to match peek layout.
- Unhang diff preview in `HistoryDialog`; add Rich/Raw toggle; fix `bg-transparent` conflicting with active-state bg color on buttons.
- Keep awaiting-input indicator after mode switch; strip `mcp__<server>__` prefix in `refreshPendingPromptsAtom` so MCP-routed prompts count as pending.
- Show real third-party authors in the Claude Plugins panel instead of defaulting to Anthropic.

## [0.58.4] - 2026-04-26


### Added
- GitHub Copilot CLI as a new AI agent provider (alpha) via ACP protocol with MCP passthrough and streaming.
- Inline diff peek and sessions pane in the git Changes tab.
- OpenCode sessions wire through Nimbalyst's MCP tools; tool calls render correctly during streaming.
- Recent files in the @ mention picker on empty query. (NIM-263)
- GPT-5.5 added to OpenAI Codex and Chat model catalogs.
- Subtle "alpha" badges on alpha-bounded features throughout the UI.

### Changed
- Redesigned Changes pane in the git panel: checkboxes, group-level Stage/Unstage/Discard, file mask filter, color-coded filenames.
- System reminder cards in the AI transcript now default to collapsed.

### Fixed
- Apply external file edits to extensions without a diff view; auto-accept diff for no-diff-mode custom editors. (NIM-379)
- Restore login widget for Claude Code auth errors; thread `isAuthError` through the canonical transcript pipeline. (NIM-377)
- Restore PATH so Claude Code stdio MCP servers can spawn npx/uvx/docker. (NIM-376)
- Require `workspacePath` on `HistoryManager.createTag` to fix NOT NULL constraint violations. (NIM-384)
- Preserve AskUserQuestion draft answers across unmount.
- Stop OpenCode transcripts from duplicating text and bleeding across sessions; add dedicated `OpenCodeRawParser`.
- Stop iOS draft sync from deleting characters during fast typing. (NIM-383)
- Show Files tab and file browsing in the iPad sidebar.
- Harden iOS webview error handling; skip transcript webview warmup on iPad.
- Give every tracker type consistent tag support. (NIM-370)
- Require custom editors to opt in to diff mode via `supportsDiffMode`.
- Stop over-counting `update_toast_shown` analytics events.
- Fix iOS CI failures from `@vscode/ripgrep` 403 rate limit.

## [0.58.3] - 2026-04-23


### Added
<!-- New features go here -->

### Changed
<!-- Changes to existing functionality go here -->

### Fixed
- Always pre-resolve the Claude Code binary path in packaged builds: the v0.58.2 "let SDK resolve" experiment (Workaround A for NIM-838) caused the SDK's `require.resolve` to return a path inside `app.asar` instead of `app.asar.unpacked`, producing `spawn ENOTDIR`. The SDK then silently fell back to the user's standalone Claude Code CLI, which ignores `--resume` and broke multi-turn sessions. Remove the `skipPreResolve` gate -- all platforms now pre-resolve via `resolveClaudeAgentCliPath()`, which correctly rewrites `app.asar` to `app.asar.unpacked`.
- Ignore transient hook session IDs that caused false resume mismatch (NIM-838 root cause): SessionStart hooks (`hook_started`, `hook_response`) emit a transient pre-resume UUID before the init frame arrives with the real session ID. `parseSystemChunk` captured `session_id` from all system chunks, so the resume-mismatch guard aborted on the hook UUID before the init frame ever arrived. Only emit `session_id` from system chunks with `subtype: "init"`; hook frames are now ignored for session ID capture.
- Hot-reload `customClaudeCodePath` without app restart: the custom Claude Code binary path was previously read once at startup and cached as a static string, so changing it in Settings had no effect until restart. Replace the static string with a loader function that reads fresh from the electron-store on each `sendMessage` call, and remove the redundant `setCustomClaudeCodePath` call from the save handler since the loader reads from the same store the save writes to. Follows the same lazy-loader pattern used by `mcpConfigLoader`, `claudeCodeSettingsLoader`, etc.
- Prevent duplicate transcript events from concurrent `ensureUpToDate` calls: concurrent `ensureUpToDate`/`processNewMessages` calls could race on the same watermark and write duplicate canonical events. Add a per-session promise-chain lock to `TranscriptTransformer` so calls serialize instead. Also log the effective binary path on each `buildSdkOptions` call to confirm `customClaudeCodePath` changes take effect without restart.
- Suppress result chunk text in resume batches to prevent duplicate assistant messages: the SDK's result chunk always echoes assistant text. When the assistant and result chunks land in separate transformer batches (observed 68ms apart, split by a throttled `ensureUpToDate`), the fresh parser's `processedTextMessageIds` is empty and the result text passes the guard. Add `suppressResultChunkText` flag to `ClaudeCodeRawParser`, set by the transformer on resume batches (`afterId > 0`) where prior batches already handled any assistant text. Slash-command-only turns still work because they're processed in the first batch.

### Removed
- NIM-838 diagnostic instrumentation: root cause (transient hook session IDs) has been found and fixed, so remove the temporary debugging infrastructure -- `DEBUG_CLAUDE_AGENT_SDK=1` env var injection on resume turns, `logResumeDiagnostic()`/`schedulePostTurn1Diagnostic()` methods, `RESUME_DIAGNOSTIC` filesystem/stderr dumps from the mismatch guard, and restore the stderr ring buffer from 200 back to 50 lines.

## [0.58.2] - 2026-04-23


### Added
<!-- New features go here -->

### Changed
- Remove Claude Code SDK prewarm end to end: prewarm was gated behind `PREWARM_ENABLED=false` after it was found to interfere with session resume and required a `canUseTool` shim to keep tool permissions working. Remove the dead path (provider fields, `prewarm`/`discardWarmQuery` methods, `ai:prewarm` IPC handler, preload bridge, type, and renderer `useEffect`), collapsing `sendMessage` to a single `query()` call and removing the warm-query shim entirely. Does not fix NIM-838 -- prewarm was already inert -- but shrinks the surface to reason about while chasing the real resume-mismatch bug.

### Fixed
- Restore Claude Code on packaged macOS/Linux (regression from v0.58.1): v0.58.1 shipped the NIM-838 workaround that passed `pathToClaudeCodeExecutable=undefined` in packaged mode so the SDK could resolve the binary itself. On packaged macOS arm64, the SDK's `require.resolve` returns a path inside `app.asar` where the binary only exists under `app.asar.unpacked`, producing `spawn ENOTDIR` on turn 1 and breaking Claude Code entirely for Mac users. Restore pre-resolution on every platform except packaged Windows, where the original NIM-838 resume-mismatch reports originated and the experiment remains open. `TeammateManager` now receives the same pre-resolved path so teammate spawns don't hit the same failure.

### Removed
<!-- Removed features go here -->

## [0.58.1] - 2026-04-23


### Added
<!-- New features go here -->

### Changed
<!-- Changes to existing functionality go here -->

### Fixed
- Diagnose and work around Claude Code session resume mismatch (NIM-838): follow-up messages in Claude Code sessions fail on v0.57.33+ with "Session resume mismatch" because the native SDK binary (0.2.114+) mints a fresh `session_id` on every `--resume` attempt. Two platform-targeted workarounds plus broad diagnostic instrumentation: stop overriding `pathToClaudeCodeExecutable` in packaged mode so the SDK's own `require.resolve` picks the binary (dev mode unchanged); force `HOME=USERPROFILE` on Windows so the binary's home resolution is deterministic across turn boundaries; enable `DEBUG_CLAUDE_AGENT_SDK=1` on resume turns and bump stderr capture to a 200-line tail-biased ring buffer for the session-lookup fingerprint; `logResumeDiagnostic` walks every plausible home root from subprocess env (HOME, USERPROFILE, APPDATA, CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR, `os.homedir()`), locates the session jsonl if it exists, and dumps the head of any `.claude/debug/sdk-*.txt` the SDK wrote, firing at preQuery, postMismatch, and +500ms/+2000ms post-turn-1 so we can separate "turn 1 never wrote" from "turn 2 reads elsewhere"; `ai_stream_interrupted` now carries `errorCategory` and `ai_request_failed.errorType` gains the same buckets so `resume_mismatch` and `stream_closed` can be split from the generic error bucket in PostHog. Full evidence chain, bare-SDK repro results, and alpha-build readiness checklist in `nimbalyst-local/plans/claude-code-resume-mismatch-investigation.md`.

### Removed
<!-- Removed features go here -->

## [0.58.0] - 2026-04-22


### Added
<!-- New features go here -->

### Changed
<!-- Changes to existing functionality go here -->

### Fixed
- Stop tracker items leaking across open projects (NIM-346): MCP tracker change broadcasts went to every BrowserWindow, so items created in one project transiently showed up in other open projects' tracker lists. Scope MCP broadcasts via `findWindowByWorkspace` so events only reach the owning workspace's window, and add a defensive workspace filter in the renderer listener so stray cross-project events are dropped before they touch the atom map.
- Stop buggy tracker widget from white-screening the app (NIM-351): a malformed tracker result with non-array `tags` threw during `CreatedView`/`RetrievedView` render and unmounted the transcript. Guard both views against non-array `item.tags`, coerce `args.tags` to an array in `tracker_create`/`tracker_update` so bad shapes from the agent aren't persisted going forward, wrap custom tool widgets in `ToolWidgetErrorBoundary` so a crashing widget renders an inline fallback instead of bringing down the transcript, and wrap the renderer root in `ErrorBoundary` as a safety net so escaped errors show a recoverable screen instead of a white screen.
- Avoid `document-service` IPC calls outside workspace windows: gate tracker sync startup on workspace-backed window state and prevent non-workspace windows (settings, help, etc.) from invoking `document-service` handlers, which produced errors and log spam when those windows were open.
- Ship working `node-pty` in the Linux AppImage (NIM-354): the Linux AppImage crashed on launch because packaged `node_modules/node-pty` contained no loadable `pty.node` for `linux-x64` -- the upstream `node-pty@1.x` npm package ships prebuilds for darwin and win32 only, and electron-builder's `install-app-deps` runs `@electron/rebuild` with `buildFromSource=false` so the Linux job silently skipped rebuilding instead of falling back to node-gyp. Add a Linux-only CI step that runs `@electron/rebuild --force` against the target Electron version and verifies `build/Release/pty.node` actually landed, and extend `validate-extra-resources.js` with a `node-pty` binary check that fails the build when no `pty.node` exists for the current target (mirroring the existing ripgrep and claude-agent-sdk checks). Catches this class of silent-skip on any platform, not just Linux.
- Remove console error when dropping a session onto itself: the drop is already a no-op but logged a noisy console error on every self-drop; now returns early without logging.

### Removed
<!-- Removed features go here -->

## [0.57.42] - 2026-04-22


### Added
- Complete the marketplace extension deep link flow: queue install requests until the renderer is ready, then open Settings > Marketplace and focus the requested extension so users landing from an external link arrive on the matching detail view.

### Changed
<!-- Changes to existing functionality go here -->

### Fixed
- Render custom tool widgets in Codex sessions: Codex reuses short per-turn item IDs (`item_1`, `item_2`, ...) across sessions, so the transcript transformer's `findByProviderToolCallId` queried globally and deduped a new session's `tool_call` against a same-named tool from a previous session, dropping the canonical event and hiding widgets like the git commit proposal. Scope the lookup to the current session by threading `sessionId` through the store interface, `processDescriptor`, the `ParseContext` wiring in `TranscriptTransformer` and `projectRawMessages`, and the `ToolCallMatcher` diff lookups. Adds a regression test covering two sessions that both call `mcp__nimbalyst-mcp__developer_git_commit_proposal` with `item_1`. Refs NIM-342.
- Detect Windows Claude Code installs correctly: the detector only looked for `claude.exe`/`claude` on PATH and missed the npm-installed `claude.cmd` shim, so users with a working Claude Code install still saw the false "Claude Code not detected" setup warning. Recognize `claude.cmd` and add regression coverage for the Windows installation check alongside the related app-startup change.
- Ship ripgrep on Windows ARM64 and the Claude Agent SDK native binary on Intel Mac: two silent `extraResources` failures caused broken release builds (ripgrep missing from Windows ARM64 installs with `spawn rg ENOENT`, and the `claude-agent-sdk` native binary missing from Intel Mac installs). Re-run `@vscode/ripgrep` postinstall explicitly after `npm ci --ignore-scripts` on `windows-11-arm` (the `--ignore-scripts` flag, added to dodge workerd's missing ARM64 prebuild, also skipped the rg.exe download); extend `validate-extra-resources` to walk `build.{mac,win,linux}.extraResources`, expand the `${arch}` macro via `BUILD_ARCH`, and assert the actual binary exists inside `@vscode/ripgrep/bin` and `@anthropic-ai/claude-agent-sdk-<platform>-<arch>`; extend `normalize-extra-resources` to handle platform-specific entries and self-heal npm hoisting in both directions; wire `validate:extra-resources` into `build:win` scripts (was only running for mac/linux).
- Restore Electron typecheck for Windows Claude detection: remove the explicit `shell` option from the new Windows Claude version checks so the Electron package compiles cleanly again.
- Scope `validate-extra-resources` to the current build platform: the v0.57.40 validator walked every `build.{mac,win,linux}.extraResources` block on every runner, so the Linux release job failed validation on `@anthropic-ai/claude-agent-sdk-darwin-x64` -- a package that isn't installed on a Linux runner and isn't needed for the Linux build output. Limit platform-scoped walking to entries whose macro matches `process.platform` (with a `BUILD_PLATFORM` override for future cross-platform scenarios); top-level `extraResources` still validate everywhere. Root cause of v0.57.40 failing to ship.
- Combine cross-arch native binary installs into a single `npm install` invocation: v0.57.41's Intel Mac build ran two sequential `npm install --no-save --force` calls (one for `@anthropic-ai/claude-agent-sdk-darwin-x64`, then one for `@openai/codex-darwin-x64`). Because neither package is recorded in `package.json`, npm treated the SDK binary as extraneous on the second invocation and pruned it -- the Codex install logged `added 1 package, removed 1 package`, leaving only Codex on disk and tripping the new extraResources validator with a "missing `claude-agent-sdk-darwin-x64`" error. Pass both package specs to a single `npm install` so npm keeps both trees intact. Root cause of v0.57.41 failing to ship.

### Removed
<!-- Removed features go here -->

## [0.57.39] - 2026-04-22


### Changed
- Release collabv3 0.1.63.
- Increase maximum width for `TrackerMainView` component.
- Bump `claude-agent-sdk` to 0.2.117, which ships Claude Code native binary 2.1.117 (built 2026-04-21). Picked up after observing a `hook_0 "Stream closed"` cascade on 2.1.116 in a non-Unknown-tool path (plain Bash, long turn, no user-facing hook configured) -- the cascade is binary-side, so the only lever on our side is the binary version. Also aligns `packages/electron/package.json` from `^0.2.114` to `^0.2.117` so all three declarations match (previously drifted during the 0.2.116 bump). Refs NIM-340.

### Fixed
- Normalize hoisted `extraResources` before Mac packaging: the previous normalize step ran inline with validation but, on Mac cross-arch builds, the packaging invocation sidestepped the normalization and the validator still saw missing `@openai/codex-sdk` paths. Run the normalize step as a dedicated pre-step in the Electron mac build flow so symlinks are in place before `validate-extra-resources` and electron-builder start, preventing CI packaging failures when workspace dependencies are hoisted. Root cause of v0.57.38 failing to ship.
- Normalize `extraResources` paths across npm hoisting layouts: npm's workspace hoisting isn't stable across platforms -- the same lockfile can place `@openai/codex-sdk` in `packages/electron/node_modules/` on one machine and in the repo root `node_modules/` on another. The electron-builder `extraResources` entries use literal paths, so when npm hoists differently the Linux CI build failed `validate-extra-resources`. Added a pre-validate normalize step that, for any entry whose electron-local path is missing but whose root-level equivalent exists, creates a symlink at the expected location. Entries are processed shallowest-first so one symlink (e.g. `@openai`) covers any nested entries (e.g. `@openai/codex-sdk`). No-op when hoisting already matches. Root cause of v0.57.37 failing to ship.
- Restore bundled ripgrep via `@vscode/ripgrep`: the claude-agent-sdk upgrade to a native binary package stopped shipping the vendored ripgrep binary at `vendor/ripgrep/<arch>/rg`. `getRipgrepPath()` fell back to system `rg`, which most users don't have, so `findWorkspaceFiles` threw `spawn rg ENOENT`, the QuickOpen cache never built, and the `@` file-mention typeahead in AIInput had no options. Added `@vscode/ripgrep` as a direct dep (postinstall fetches the host-arch rg), rewrote `getRipgrepPath()` to resolve the binary in dev and packaged builds, bundled via `extraResources` into `app.asar.unpacked/node_modules/@vscode/ripgrep`, and extended the CI cross-arch install step to re-run postinstall with `npm_config_arch` so cross-compile jobs pack the correct binary.
- Lock `@vscode/ripgrep` in package-lock.json so CI installs the same version used to bundle rg.
- Pass `GITHUB_TOKEN` to the `@vscode/ripgrep` postinstall on CI: `@vscode/ripgrep` downloads its rg binary from `ripgrep-prebuilt` GitHub releases during postinstall. Unauthenticated CI runners hit the 403 rate limit, breaking `npm ci`. Expose `secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN` on both the initial install step and the cross-arch re-download step so the postinstall authenticates its fetch. This was the root cause of v0.57.36 failing to ship.
- Stop `hook_0 Stream closed` cascade on Claude Code 2.1.116: long agent turns hit repeated `Error in hook callback hook_0` / `Tool permission request failed: Error: Stream closed` failures as soon as the agent invoked one of the CLI's new built-in tools (`Monitor`, `ExitWorktree`, crons, etc.). The old `SDK_NATIVE_TOOLS` whitelist missed those tools, so Nimbalyst tried to execute them locally, threw `Unknown tool`, and destabilized the CLI<->host control stream for the rest of the turn -- the agent then retried blindly for minutes. Added `Monitor`, `ExitWorktree`, `PushNotification`, `RemoteTrigger`, `CronCreate/Delete/List`, `ListMcpResources(Tool)`, `ReadMcpResource(Tool)`, `Config`, `Mcp` to `SDK_NATIVE_TOOLS`; replaced the unknown-tool throw with a warn-and-skip that assumes CLI-native so future tool additions log one line instead of breaking the stream. Refs NIM-340.
- Narrow `STREAM_CLOSED_RAW_CHUNK` diagnostic to real errors: was matching any chunk whose JSON contained the string "Stream closed", firing on successful tool results that legitimately mentioned the phrase (e.g., `git log` echoing a commit message about the stream-close fix). Narrowed to only match user/tool_result chunks with `is_error=true` and "Stream closed" in the content string. Verified against archived cascades: every real stream-close event still matches; the commit-message false positive no longer does.
- Silence `TreeMatcher` guidepost error on unchanged subtrees: when a list subtree is diffed and its children have identical text, the synthetic source/target markdown blobs match exactly and `createTwoFilesPatch` returns a patch with zero hunks, which `parseUnifiedDiff` rejects as invalid. The caller already swallows the error but logged noisily. Short-circuit `buildTextBasedGuidePosts` when the blobs are identical so the diff library is never invoked in this case.

## [0.57.35] - 2026-04-22


### Fixed
- Shared/hybrid tracker types rendering blank in workspaces with no team: routed through the collaborative editor path which couldn't resolve a DocumentRoom, leaving the detail panel stuck on "No content". Now detects team membership as a tri-state (pending/no-team/team) in `TrackerItemDetail`, skips the document-sync IPC when no team exists (falls back to the local PGLite Lexical editor that already backs collab content), and holds the loading state while team detection is in flight so the editor doesn't briefly mount in the wrong mode.
- electron-store failing to load in packaged builds with `Cannot find module 'p-try'`: the allowlist-style `build.files` array was missing `p-try`, which `pkg-up`'s nested `p-limit@2.3.0` requires. Broke the project move feature. Added `p-try` to the allowlist.
- Unrelated SDK errors misreported as "session expired": the post-error fallback was using `~/.claude/history.jsonl` as authority for whether a resumed session still existed. When the lookup missed (write-timing races, programmatic sessions the SDK never logs to history), any unrelated SDK error was swapped for a "session expired" message and the session mapping deleted, forcing the user onto a fresh conversation. Demoted the check to a soft diagnostic and preserve the session mapping -- real expiry is still caught upstream via the SDK's own error signature.

## [0.57.34] - 2026-04-22


### Added
- Collaborative tracker content editing via DocumentRoom: team-synced tracker items using Yjs with review gate, awareness cursors, and PGLite persistence. TrackerItemDetail now supports three content paths (file-backed, local-pglite, collaborative); review banner shows pending remote changes with accept/reject; server auto-repairs corrupt tracker items by re-encrypting from local PGLite data when decryption fails. 1MB content size limit enforced. Configurable TTL on DocumentRoom (tracker content rooms use 90-day TTL).
- Extension marketplace update flow: auto-updates installed marketplace extensions silently on app launch, update indicators in Discover tab (cards + detail modal), per-extension Update button and Update All in Installed tab, new `/release-extension` command, bundled registry updated with mindmap v1.0.1.
- Pre-fetch commit context to eliminate agent discovery latency: new `git:get-commit-context` IPC handler cross-references session-edited files with git status before sending to the agent. `handleSmartCommit` injects the pre-fetched file list into the prompt so the agent calls `developer_git_commit_proposal` immediately. New `CommitRequestCard` widget renders commit-request user messages as a collapsible card instead of raw prompt text.
- Capture `cpu_arch` as PostHog person property so user base can be segmented by CPU architecture (arm64, x64) -- GitHub download counts lose this fidelity once pre-split generic assets are in the mix.

### Fixed
- Session resume failing in packaged builds: `setupClaudeCodeEnvironment()` was overlaying a synthetic env on top of the carefully sanitized `process.env`, clobbering it. Designed for the old Node.js execution path but the native binary doesn't need NODE_PATH/PATH rewrites -- just HOME. Removed the overlay so dev and packaged mode launch the binary with the same environment. Also: `checkSessionExists` fails open when `~/.claude/history.jsonl` is missing (fixes Windows where the CLI may store data elsewhere), stopping real SDK errors from being misdiagnosed as "session expired".
- MIME type resolution for chat attachments: `.log`, `.ts`, `.py`, `.yaml`, and other text-based files were rejected as "unsupported file type" because browsers report empty or `application/octet-stream` MIME for those extensions. Added extension-to-MIME fallback map (~70 extensions), passed filename through to validation, and broadened supported document MIME list (html, xml, yaml, js, ts, etc.).
- iOS compose bar clearing dictated text after keyboard voice input: dismiss focus before clearing the text binding on send/queue so any in-flight keyboard dictation commits first. Otherwise UIKit's pending dictation buffer re-inserted text after the clear, leaving the dictated message stuck.
- Tracker content editor destroying/remounting on every save by removing `updatedAt` dependency from content load effect.
- Model picker showing raw variant ID for pinned opus-4-6 on initial load: use `CLAUDE_CODE_MODEL_LABELS` map instead of naive first-char capitalization so `opus-4-6` displays as `Opus` not `Opus-4-6`. Matches server-side label format (dot separator).
- `scheduleAIProviderPersist` re-sending stale debug settings: provider saves fetched `currentSettings` via `aiGetSettings()` and re-sent `showToolCalls`/`aiDebugLogging` alongside `apiKeys`/`providerSettings`. If a debug toggle changed while a provider save was in the 500ms debounce window, the older debug values were re-saved over the fresh ones. The `ai:saveSettings` handler guards every field with `!== undefined`, so dropping those keys preserves existing values. Last remaining holdout of the NIM-801 spread pattern.
- Dropping advanced settings when debounce timer resets: toggling Extension Dev Tools (or any `changedKeys`-driven advanced setting) silently failed to persist when another setting mutated within the 500ms debounce window. The scheduler captured `changedKeys` in a `setTimeout` closure and cleared the pending timer on each call, losing the first call's keys entirely. Accumulate `changedKeys` into a module-level Set and capture the latest settings snapshot so the flushed timer sees every queued change. Same fix applied to `scheduleDeveloperFeaturePersist`.

### Removed
- Failing mermaid import exploration test (debugging artifact with `console.log` diagnostics whose subgraph case asserted on the `mermaid-to-excalidraw` library's internal fallback for inputs it throws on; consistently failing CI with no production code relying on the assertion).

## [0.57.33] - 2026-04-21


### Added
<!-- New features go here -->

### Changed
<!-- Changes to existing functionality go here -->

### Fixed
- Intel Mac packaged build was missing the Claude Code x64 SDK binary due to three compounding issues:
  - `afterPack.js` used `packager.arch` which was falsy for some arch values, falling through to `process.arch` (arm64 on the build machine). Pruning kept the arm64 binary and deleted the x64 one. Now uses `context.arch`.
  - electron-builder's `files` patterns only include packages in the npm dependency tree. The `--no-save` cross-arch install isn't in the lock file, so `files` globs silently skipped it. Added `mac.extraResources` with the `${arch}` macro to copy the binary from root `node_modules` regardless of lock-file state.
  - Simplified the CI cross-arch install to put the binary in root `node_modules/`, where `extraResources` reads from.
- Added diagnostic logging and improved error messages when Claude Code binary resolution fails at runtime (shows which package and arch were expected).

## [0.57.32] - 2026-04-21


### Added
<!-- New features go here -->

### Changed
- Upgrade Claude Agent SDK 0.2.114 -> 0.2.116 (permission dialog crash fix, session resume perf, API 400 race condition fix) and `@anthropic-ai/sdk` 0.71.2 -> 0.81.0 (deduped with the agent SDK dependency)
- Address 36 npm audit vulnerabilities including 2 critical: upgrade `simple-git` 3.30.0 -> 3.36.0 (command execution RCE fix), `mcp-remote` 0.1.37 -> 0.1.38, plus high-severity fixes in `vite`, `rollup`, `tar`, `picomatch`, `path-to-regexp`, `@hono/node-server`, `@xmldom/xmldom`, `undici`, and others. Remaining 30 are upstream/transitive with no fix available.

### Fixed
- Cross-arch SDK install step hitting `ERR_PACKAGE_PATH_NOT_EXPORTED`: `@anthropic-ai/claude-agent-sdk` and `@openai/codex` both have an `exports` field in `package.json` that doesn't expose `./package.json`, so `require.resolve('<pkg>/package.json', { paths: [...] })` fails regardless of the `paths` option. Probe the known `node_modules` locations with bash file existence, then `require()` the absolute path -- absolute paths bypass `exports` resolution and just read the file.
- Restore typecheck after the `@types/node` bump pulled in by the npm audit fix: TypeScript 5.7+'s newer `Uint8Array<ArrayBufferLike>` / `Buffer<ArrayBufferLike>` definitions narrow `SharedArrayBuffer` out of `ArrayBuffer`, breaking ~13 `crypto.subtle.*`, `fetch`, and `new Blob()` call sites. Added `as BufferSource` / `as BodyInit` / `as BlobPart` casts at the boundaries in `ShareHandlers.ts`, `KeyRotationService.ts`, `OrgKeyService.ts`, `CollabAssetService.ts`, and the runtime sync providers (`DocumentSync.ts`, `ECDHKeyManager.ts`, `ProjectSyncProvider.ts`, `TeamSync.ts`, `TrackerSync.ts`). All heap-allocated `Uint8Array`s, so the casts are safe at runtime.
- Intel Mac "spawn ENOTDIR" reproduced after the v0.57.29 attempt: running `npm install --prefix packages/electron/` makes npm read that workspace's `package.json`, which lists `@nimbalyst/runtime` and other workspace siblings as dependencies. Without workspace context npm tries to resolve those from the public registry and 404s. Install into a temp directory that has no workspace neighbors, then copy the binary into `packages/electron/node_modules/` where electron-builder can find it.
- Tool permission prompts lost after renderer reload: `safeSend` silently dropped events when the original `webContents` was destroyed (e.g., HMR reload), so the pending permission promise never resolved and the SDK stream timed out with "Stream closed". Now falls back to any live `BrowserWindow`.
- Always include subprocess stderr in error messages: previously stderr was only appended to errors containing "exited with code", losing diagnostic context for native binary crashes producing "Stream closed" or other errors.

### Added
<!-- New features go here -->

### Changed
- Upgrade Claude Agent SDK 0.2.114 -> 0.2.116 (permission dialog crash fix, session resume perf, API 400 race condition fix) and `@anthropic-ai/sdk` 0.71.2 -> 0.81.0 (deduped with the agent SDK dependency)
- Address 36 npm audit vulnerabilities including 2 critical: upgrade `simple-git` 3.30.0 -> 3.36.0 (command execution RCE fix), `mcp-remote` 0.1.37 -> 0.1.38, plus high-severity fixes in `vite`, `rollup`, `tar`, `picomatch`, `path-to-regexp`, `@hono/node-server`, `@xmldom/xmldom`, `undici`, and others. Remaining 30 are upstream/transitive with no fix available.

### Fixed
- Cross-arch SDK install step on CI now uses `require.resolve(..., { paths: ['./packages/electron'] })` to look up the Claude Agent SDK and Codex versions: the previous hardcoded `./packages/electron/node_modules/...` path didn't exist when npm workspaces hoisted the SDK to the root `node_modules/`, which broke the Intel Mac cross-arch install and cascaded into fail-fast cancellations for the whole matrix.
- Restore typecheck after the `@types/node` bump pulled in by the npm audit fix: TypeScript 5.7+'s newer `Uint8Array<ArrayBufferLike>` / `Buffer<ArrayBufferLike>` definitions narrow `SharedArrayBuffer` out of `ArrayBuffer`, breaking ~13 `crypto.subtle.*`, `fetch`, and `new Blob()` call sites. Added `as BufferSource` / `as BodyInit` / `as BlobPart` casts at the boundaries in `ShareHandlers.ts`, `KeyRotationService.ts`, `OrgKeyService.ts`, `CollabAssetService.ts`, and the runtime sync providers (`DocumentSync.ts`, `ECDHKeyManager.ts`, `ProjectSyncProvider.ts`, `TeamSync.ts`, `TrackerSync.ts`). All heap-allocated `Uint8Array`s, so the casts are safe at runtime.
- Intel Mac "spawn ENOTDIR" reproduced after the v0.57.29 attempt: running `npm install --prefix packages/electron/` makes npm read that workspace's `package.json`, which lists `@nimbalyst/runtime` and other workspace siblings as dependencies. Without workspace context npm tries to resolve those from the public registry and 404s, aborting the install before any native binary lands on disk. Install into a temp directory that has no workspace neighbors, then copy the binary into `packages/electron/node_modules/` where electron-builder can find it. Same pattern for the Codex binary.
- Tool permission prompts lost after renderer reload: `safeSend` silently dropped events when the original `webContents` was destroyed (e.g., HMR reload), so the pending permission promise never resolved and the SDK stream timed out with "Stream closed". Now falls back to any live `BrowserWindow` so the permission UI still appears after a renderer reload.
- Always include subprocess stderr in error messages: previously stderr was only appended to errors containing "exited with code", so native binary crashes producing "Stream closed" or other errors had their stderr silently dropped, losing diagnostic context needed to debug intermittent binary deaths.

### Changed
<!-- Changes to existing functionality go here -->

### Fixed
- Intel Mac "spawn ENOTDIR" still reproduced after v0.57.28: npm workspaces hoist packages to the root `node_modules/` even when `npm install` is run from a child directory, so the darwin-x64 SDK binaries kept landing where electron-builder couldn't find them. Use `--install-strategy=nested --prefix` to bypass workspace hoisting and force the binaries into `packages/electron/node_modules/`. Added a post-install verification step that fails the CI job immediately if the binary is missing at the expected path.

## [0.57.28] - 2026-04-20


### Added
<!-- New features go here -->

### Changed
- Gate SDK prewarm behind `PREWARM_ENABLED=false` temporarily while the session resume and canUseTool plumbing bakes

### Fixed
- Intel Mac "spawn ENOTDIR" on launch: run the cross-arch npm install from `packages/electron/` (not the monorepo root) so the darwin-x64 Claude Agent SDK and Codex binaries land in `packages/electron/node_modules/` where electron-builder's `files` patterns can resolve them. Keeps `macos-latest` as the runner since GitHub is phasing out Intel runners.
- Session resume silently starting fresh conversations after a Nimbalyst restart: `ai:prewarm` cached the Claude Code provider without calling `setProviderSessionData`, so `sessions.getSessionId()` returned undefined and the SDK spawned a brand-new session with no visible error. `setProviderSessionData` now runs on every `sendMessage`, the prewarm IPC handler also restores session data, and the restore is asserted against the DB. The stream now compares the SDK-reported `session_id` against `options.resume` for Claude Code, Codex threads, and managed teammates, throwing on mismatch so silent resume failures surface loudly.
- canUseTool Zod errors on every tool call after prewarm: the prewarm stub returned `true`, which spread into `{toolUseID: ...}` with no `behavior`/`updatedInput`/`message` and failed the CLI's Zod schema. Replaced with a delegating shim backed by `warmCanUseToolRef`; the real session-bound handler is installed before the warm query is reused.

### Changed
- Gate SDK prewarm behind `PREWARM_ENABLED=false` temporarily while the session resume and canUseTool plumbing bakes

### Fixed
- Mac x64 build switched to a native macos-13 Intel runner instead of cross-compiling on ARM64: SDK native binaries were landing in root `node_modules/` where electron-builder couldn't find them, causing "spawn ENOTDIR" on Intel Macs. The cross-arch install step is no longer needed.
- Session resume silently starting fresh conversations after a Nimbalyst restart: `ai:prewarm` cached the Claude Code provider without calling `setProviderSessionData`, so `sessions.getSessionId()` returned undefined and the SDK spawned a brand-new session with no visible error. `setProviderSessionData` now runs on every `sendMessage`, the prewarm IPC handler also restores session data, and the restore is asserted against the DB.

## [0.57.26] - 2026-04-20


### Added
- canUseTool Zod schema compliance tests (43 tests) covering immediateToolDecision trust modes / team tools / MCP tools / delegation, toolAuthorization service and fallback permission flows, askUserQuestion answer/cancel/abort paths, and the canUseToolNormalization safety net

### Changed
- Opt GitHub Actions workflows into the Node.js 24 runtime (FORCE_JAVASCRIPT_ACTIONS_TO_NODE24=true) to silence deprecation warnings ahead of the forced default in June 2026

### Fixed
- Use `npm install --force` for the cross-arch native binary step so npm accepts platform-specific optional dependencies on the arm64 CI runner (was failing the CPU check and blocking the Intel Mac build fix from actually shipping)
- Intel Mac builds now ship with the correct native binaries: CI installs target-arch Claude Agent SDK and OpenAI Codex packages when cross-compiling macOS x64 on an arm64 runner, resolving "CLI not found" errors
- Windows agent mode input is focusable on the first session: guard auto-focus with an offsetParent visibility check and use IntersectionObserver to retry when the panel becomes visible
- Windows auto-update relaunches the app after silent install (flip NSIS runAfterFinish to true) so the update flow matches macOS
- Race condition in ElectronDocumentService where refreshWorkspaceData didn't set initializationPromise, letting listDocumentMetadata start a competing background scan that blocked subsequent refreshes via the isScanning guard
- Remove stale ELECTRON_RUN_AS_NODE assertion in the claudeCodeEnvironment test (env var was intentionally removed during the native binary SDK upgrade)

- Consolidate iOS CI from 3 sequential macOS jobs to 1, cutting roughly two-thirds of runner time by removing redundant npm ci/simulator boot/Xcode setup and no-op UI test plan check

### Fixed
- Restore login/logout after the Claude Agent SDK upgrade to native binary packaging: resolve the platform-specific binary path instead of the removed cli.js, run the binary directly instead of via ELECTRON_RUN_AS_NODE, and fall back to system-installed claude.exe on Windows
- Normalize canUseTool response shape (updatedInput on allow, message on deny) in the ClaudeCodeProvider wrapper to satisfy the SDK native binary's Zod schema validation
- Silence noisy auth/sync logs for unauthenticated users in collabDocuments, SyncManager, and iOS SyncManager/DocumentSyncManager so startup logs stay clean when signed out

- Log canUseTool return values in ClaudeCodeProvider to diagnose SDK validation failures

### Fixed
- Silent Windows auto-updates so users no longer see the NSIS installer wizard
- Prevent duplicate tool call entries in agent provider transcripts (claude-code, codex, opencode) by gating the legacy addMessage path to chat providers only
- Migrate existing users' persisted Claude Code model list to include the Opus 4.6 variant so upgrading Windows users see it again in the Agent picker
- Default Claude Code model list now includes Opus 4.6 for fresh installs
- Restore actual release notes (from CHANGELOG.md) on internal GitHub Releases instead of the hardcoded boilerplate that had been used since Sep 2025
- Restore package-lock.json optional flags that were stripped by npm install during the SDK upgrade, unblocking CI on Linux x64

- Prune non-target SDK binaries in afterPack to shrink installer by ~500MB
- Runtime tsconfig upgraded to ES2024 for AsyncDisposable support; zod pinned to v3.23 for claude-agent-sdk compatibility

### Fixed

## [0.57.14] - 2026-04-16


### Added
- Claude Opus 4.7 with the full 1M-token context window as the default Claude model (`claude:claude-opus-4-7`). Opus 4.7 uses 1M context natively on the Messages API — no `context-1m-2025-08-07` beta header required, unlike Opus 4.6. Previous default (Sonnet 4.6) remains selectable.
- Commit-tracker item linking with opt-in automation settings
- Session phase badges shown in agent mode history panel

### Changed
- Upgraded `@anthropic-ai/claude-agent-sdk` from 0.2.87 to 0.2.111 (Opus 4.7 support, task management, agent teams, plan-mode refinements)
- Upgraded `@openai/codex-sdk` from 0.117.0 to 0.121.0
- Upgraded `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk` to 1.29.0
- Claude Agent variant label now reports Opus 4.7 (was Opus 4.6)
- Simplified tracker automation to 2 toggles with CLAUDE.md hint
- Lowered tool-search threshold to 2%
- Local config for trackers: added blog, bug, and task metadata configurations

### Fixed
- Unconditionally strip `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` and `OPENAI_API_KEY` from `process.env` at main-process startup; explicitly clear them in `options.env` for the Claude Code SDK and in the Codex child-process env so the 0.2.111 overlay behavior (which no longer replaces `process.env`) cannot silently re-introduce a shell-inherited key
- Deduplicate claude-code notification text between assistant and result chunks
- Correct Opus 4.7 context window reporting to 1M
- Defer React root.unmount() to avoid render race condition
- iOS transcript loading deadlock and unified iPad/iPhone session list
- Awaiting-input indicator visibility and priority in session history
- Tracker comments now appear immediately after posting

## [0.57.13] - 2026-04-15


### Added
- Main-process commit event subscription API in GitRefWatcher

### Changed
- Updated About window copy to reflect current product positioning

### Fixed
- OS notifications now show actual response text and session title instead of text before trailing tool calls
- Tracker sync: content refetch retry, nullish checks, and dbRowToRecord improvements
- Prevent aiSaveSettings callers from clobbering unrelated fields via read-modify-write
- Wire tracker comments, activity, and content through sync pipeline
- Tracker items created via MCP now get local issue keys and proper content formatting
- Unified shift/cmd-click selection across all session group types
- Persist fieldUpdatedAt timestamps for correct tracker sync last-write-wins
- Render system errors as errors instead of system reminders
- @@session reference links now navigate to the referenced session
- Auto-open workspace when mobile sends prompts to a closed project
- Unified tracker kanban and list view data sources to eliminate ghost entries

- Deduplicated Codex tool call events with recycled item IDs
- Hardened OAuth MCP server flows to prevent unauthorized remote servers from triggering login on startup
