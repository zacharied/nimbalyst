## Collaboration

> **Encryption posture.** Team collaboration data (trackers, documents, doc-index
> titles) is **encrypted in transit and at rest, isolated per team, and operated
> by Nimbalyst**. Two custody modes per team:
> `legacy-e2e` (client-side zero-knowledge ECDH; the original default) and
> `server-managed` (Epic H2 — the server holds a per-team KMS-wrapped key and
> encrypts at rest, enabling web/CLI/cloud-agent access). **Server-managed team
> data is not zero-knowledge.** **Personal sync** (your desktop ↔ phone: sessions,
> prompts, drafts, settings, personal index) **stays zero-knowledge** — the server
> never holds those keys. Customers who require true zero-knowledge for team data
> run the software on their own infrastructure (self-host).

- Real-time document editing (Lexical + yJS through Cloudflare Workers)
- Encrypted tracker item sync (zero-knowledge in `legacy-e2e`; server-managed at-rest in H2)
- Team trust model with ECDH key exchange and key envelopes (legacy-e2e mode)
- Server-managed per-team encryption keys (Epic H2): KMS-wrapped split-knowledge DEK, admin key-recovery, append-only audit log
- Stytch B2B org management
- Team invite / join / role management
- Personal org + team org separation
- Multiple projects per organization — add another workspace to an existing org as its own tracker space (sharing the org's roster and encryption)
- Organization settings scope (User | Organization | Project) keyed off the org switcher — members & roles, projects & access, security & encryption in one org-admin surface
- Move a project to another organization — relocates its trackers, documents, history, and schemas into the destination, transfers member access by email (auto-invite for members not yet in the destination, with a per-person opt-out and seat-delta preview), and redirects the old location (server-managed orgs only)
- Merge one organization into another — consolidates every project, unions the rosters (higher role wins), and optionally deletes the drained org
- Shared document list
- Key envelope distribution for new members
- Durable Objects per entity (session, document, tracker, team, index)
- **Extension-provided collab editors** — SDK `useCollaborativeEditor` hook lets any extension (Excalidraw, CSV spreadsheet, DatamodelLM shipped; others can opt in via `collaboration.supported` manifest flag) share its file type to team with real-time multi-client editing, cursors, and selection
- **Client-side snapshot compaction** — connected clients periodically send `docCompact` so initial sync stays fast as edit history grows (single-elector by lowest userId)

## Tracker System

- Tracker mode (Cmd+T) with list, table, kanban, and tag-board views
- Kanban columns honor each type's status order from its schema (no hardcoded order)
- Tag-board view with one column per tag (items appear in every matching column, plus an Untagged column)
- Saved views: name, save, apply, and delete reusable filter/layout views per workspace
- Configurable tracker item types (bugs, tasks, architecture docs, decisions, etc.)
- Tracker sidebar with type counts
- Item detail panel
- Encrypted sync across team members (zero-knowledge in `legacy-e2e`; server-managed at-rest in H2)
- Inline `#type` items in markdown (TrackerPlugin)
- Live tracker reference links — `#` in a document references an existing tracker item, inserting a chip that shows the item's current status and title (resolved live, not a snapshot) and links to it; serialized as portable `[NIM-123](nimbalyst://NIM-123)` markdown; the same link renders as a live chip in the AI transcript; one-click "convert to tracked reference" turns a legacy inline embed into a real tracked item plus a reference chip
- Tracker schema overrides in Trackers settings -- customize a built-in type into `.nimbalyst/trackers`, edit an existing override, reset back to the built-in default, and resync the local database mirror when schema files drift
- External-source importers: import GitHub issues (extension-provided) into the tracker as native bug, task, or feature items with a back-link to the source, a "from GitHub" chip, re-snapshot ("pull latest from source") with conservative merge, and a Source filter; agent tools `tracker_importer_list` / `tracker_importer_search` / `tracker_import` / `tracker_resnapshot` / `tracker_get_by_urn`
- Per-project "AI Agent Access" toggle in tracker settings -- allow or block AI agents from using tracker tools in that project (on by default)

## MCP Servers (Internal)

- Session context (summaries, workstream overview, recent sessions, edited files, scheduled wakeups)
- Session naming (name, tags, phase)
- Meta-agent (`create_session`, `spawn_session`, `send_prompt`, `respond_to_prompt`, `get_session_status`, `get_session_result`, `list_spawned_sessions`, `list_worktrees`) — lets a session spawn and orchestrate child, sibling, or isolated sessions
- Settings control (`settings_get_overview`, `workspace_create`, `workspace_open`, `sync_set_for_project`, `appearance_set_theme`, `analytics_set_enabled`, `ai_set_default_model`, `features_toggle`, `extension_set_enabled`, `tracker_set_sync_policy`, etc.) — lets the agent change Nimbalyst settings through a curated, allow-listed surface; never exposes API keys or auth credentials; kill-switch via `settingsAgentToolsDisabled`

- Two-pass anonymization: regex pass via `feedback_anonymize_text` MCP tool, then LLM second-pass review before any redacted text is shown to the user
- Issue posting via `feedback_open_github_issue` MCP tool, which opens a pre-filled `github.com/nimbalyst/nimbalyst/issues/new` URL using the right issue-form template (`bug_report.yml` or `feature_request.yml`) and routes the body into the template's primary textarea field; the template's frontmatter applies the GitHub issue type and `status:needs-triage` label automatically. Falls back to copy-paste when the body exceeds the safe URL length
- Secondary links: Browse existing issues, Discuss on GitHub Discussions, Email private feedback to support@nimbalyst.com
