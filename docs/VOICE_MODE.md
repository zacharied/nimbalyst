# Voice Mode

Voice mode provides a hands-free conversational interface to Nimbalyst's AI coding sessions. A voice agent (OpenAI Realtime API) handles speech-to-speech interaction with the user, while the existing coding agent (Claude Code or Codex) performs all technical work. The two agents coordinate through the main process.

## Architecture Overview

Voice mode is a **dual-agent architecture** layered on top of existing AI sessions:

```

Voice mode does **not** replace the coding session. It augments it. The voice agent serves as a conversational relay -- translating spoken requests into coding tasks, forwarding them to the coding agent, and speaking the results back.

## Data Flow

### User Speaks -> Coding Agent Executes -> Voice Responds

```
1. User speaks into microphone
     │
2. AudioCapture (renderer) captures 24kHz PCM16, base64-encodes
     │
3. VoiceModeButton sends via IPC: voice-mode:send-audio
     │  (gated: only when listenState === 'listening')
     │
4. VoiceModeService (main) forwards to RealtimeAPIClient.sendAudio()
     │
5. RealtimeAPIClient sends to OpenAI via WebSocket: input_audio_buffer.append
     │
6. OpenAI VAD detects speech end, transcribes (streaming gpt-realtime-whisper), generates response
     │
7. If voice agent calls submit_agent_prompt tool:
     │  a. RealtimeAPIClient.handleFunctionCall() invokes onSubmitPromptCallback
     │  b. VoiceModeService sends IPC: voice-mode:submit-prompt -> renderer
     │  c. voiceModeListeners invokes registered submit callback
     │  d. VoiceModeButton routes to AIInput's pendingVoiceCommandSetter
     │  e. After delay (configurable submitDelayMs), prompt is queued via ai:createQueuedPrompt
     │  f. Coding agent (Claude Code) processes the prompt
     │  g. On completion, voiceModeListeners receives onAIStreamResponse with isComplete=true
     │  h. Renderer sends IPC: voice-mode:agent-task-complete with summary
     │  i. VoiceModeService receives completion. On gpt-realtime-2 it resolves the
     │     still-open submit_agent_prompt call with the summary (async function
     │     calling); on the gpt-realtime fallback it injects [INTERNAL: Task complete...]
     │  j. Voice agent speaks the result to the user
     │
8. Voice agent audio response flows back:
     a. OpenAI sends response.audio.delta events
     b. RealtimeAPIClient invokes onAudioCallback
     c. VoiceModeService sends IPC: voice-mode:audio-received -> renderer
     d. voiceModeListeners invokes registered audio callback
     e. AudioPlayback (renderer) decodes and plays PCM16
```

### Ask Coding Agent (Synchronous Q&A)

The `ask_coding_agent` tool provides a synchronous request-response pattern. The voice agent submits a question prefixed with `[VOICE]`, the coding agent processes it, and the voice agent receives the answer as the function call result (with a 60-second timeout).

### Interactive Prompt Forwarding

When the coding agent presents an interactive prompt (AskUserQuestion, ExitPlanMode, GitCommitProposal):

1. `voiceModeListeners` subscribes to `sessionPendingPromptsAtom` for the linked session
2. On new prompt, wakes voice from sleeping state
3. Sends IPC `voice-mode:interactive-prompt` with a voice-friendly description
4. VoiceModeService calls `poc.sendUserMessage()` with `[INTERACTIVE PROMPT: ...]`
5. Voice agent reads the prompt aloud and waits for user answer
6. Voice agent calls `respond_to_interactive_prompt` tool
7. VoiceModeService sends IPC `voice-mode:respond-to-prompt` -> renderer
8. `voiceModeListeners` uses `respondToPromptAtom` to submit the answer

## State Management

### Jotai Atoms

All voice state lives in workspace-scoped atoms (not per-session) because only one voice session can be active at a time. Atoms are updated exclusively by `voiceModeListeners.ts` -- components never subscribe to IPC directly.

| Atom | Type | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `voiceActiveSessionIdAtom` | `string \ | null` | ID of the linked coding session (not the voice DB session) |
| `voiceListenStateAtom` | `'off' \ | 'listening' \ | 'sleeping'` | Three-state listening model |
| `voiceTranscriptEntriesAtom` | `VoiceTranscriptEntry[]` | Accumulated user/assistant transcript entries |
| `voiceCurrentUserTextAtom` | `string` | Live partial transcription while user speaks |
| `voiceTokenUsageAtom` | `VoiceTokenUsage \ | null` | Input/output audio and text token counts |
| `voiceSessionStartTimeAtom` | `number \ | null` | When the current voice session started |
| `voiceWorkspacePathAtom` | `string \ | null` | Workspace path for the voice session |
| `voiceDbSessionIdAtom` | `string \ | null` | Database session ID (separate from linked coding session) |
| `voiceLastReportedFileAtom` | `string \ | null` | Last file path sent to voice agent (dedup) |
| `voiceErrorAtom` | `{ type; message } \ | null` | Current error state |
| `pendingVoiceCommandAtom` | `PendingVoiceCommand \ | null` | Pending voice command awaiting countdown |

### Listen State Machine

Voice mode uses a three-state listening model managed by `voiceModeListeners.ts`:

```
  ┌─────────┐
  │   off   │ ◄── Voice mode not active
  └────┬────┘
       │ start
  ┌────▼────┐
  │listening│ ◄── Mic open, audio flowing, timer running
  └────┬────┘
       │ timer expires / pause_listening tool
  ┌────▼────┐
  │sleeping │ ◄── WebSocket connected, mic paused
  └────┬────┘
       │ wake events (task complete, interactive prompt, user tap)
       └────── back to listening
```

**Timer management** (owned by `VoiceListenWindowController` in `voiceListenWindow.ts`, a pure unit-tested seam):
- The controller arms a countdown (default 15s, configurable via `listenWindowMs`)
- While the user is speaking (`voice-mode:speech-started`, the unconditional VAD signal), the countdown is cleared AND every arm request is held -- a token-usage from a barge-in-cancelled response, a late transcript-complete for the previous utterance, or a playback drain arriving mid-utterance cannot start a countdown that would expire while the user is still talking (NIM-1594). Held requests are logged (`Listen window: held open during speech`) as `[system]` diagnostic transcript entries.
- The countdown arms after speech ends (speech_stopped) or after the assistant finishes responding (token-usage / playback drain)
- The countdown is cleared while assistant is speaking (audio chunks arriving)
- Expiry transitions to `sleeping` state; the explicit `pause_listening` tool sleeps immediately regardless of speech state

When sleeping:
- Audio capture continues running but `VoiceModeButton` gates sending based on listen state
- Main process inactivity monitor is suspended
- Voice wakes automatically on: interactive prompt, task completion, or user clicking the button

## Voice Agent Tools

The OpenAI Realtime API session is configured with these function-calling tools:

| Tool | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `submit_agent_prompt` | Queue a coding task for the coding agent. On gpt-realtime-2 this is an async (deferred) call: it stays open and the coding agent's summary is delivered as the tool result when work completes. On the gpt-realtime fallback it returns a synthetic "queued" result and the completion arrives via an injected `[INTERNAL: Task complete]` wake message. |
| `ask_coding_agent` | Send a synchronous question to the coding agent (60s timeout) |
| `respond_to_interactive_prompt` | Answer a pending AskUserQuestion, ExitPlanMode, or GitCommitProposal |
| `stop_voice_session` | End the voice session |
| `pause_listening` | Put the mic to sleep (WebSocket stays connected) |
| `get_session_summary` | Get a summary of the linked coding session |
| `list_sessions` | List recent AI sessions in the workspace |
| `navigate_to_session` | Switch the UI to a specific AI session |
| `create_session` | Create a new coding session and switch to it. Repeated creation calls are deduplicated until the next coding prompt, which is pinned to the created session even if the active UI session changes. |
| `propose_commit` | Trigger the "Commit with AI" feature. Sends `voice-mode:propose-commit` to the renderer, which runs the same logic as the Smart Commit button in `GitOperationsPanel`: pre-fetches files via `git:get-commit-context`, then dispatches an `ai:sendMessage` with the canonical `Use the developer_git_commit_proposal tool to create a commit.` prefix so the `CommitRequestCard` widget appears in the transcript. The resulting `git_commit_proposal_request` interactive prompt flows back to the voice agent through the existing interactive-prompt forwarding for verbal approve/reject. |

## Extension Voice Tools & Context Providers (general core hooks)

Any extension can contribute to the voice agent, not just a dedicated grounding extension. There are two general hooks, both bridging the renderer (where extension code runs) to the main process (where the voice session runs).

### Core hook 1 — Extension voice tools

An extension AI tool opts in by setting `voiceAgent: true` on its `ExtensionAITool`. The same tool shape/handler/`inputSchema` serves both the coding agent and the voice agent.

- The flag is threaded through the existing tool registry: `MCPToolDefinition` (renderer, `ExtensionAIToolsBridge`) → `ExtensionToolDefinition` (main, `mcpWorkspaceResolver`). `getVoiceEnabledExtensionTools(workspacePath)` returns the opted-in tools for a workspace.
- At voice session start, `VoiceModeService` queries those tools, converts each via `buildVoiceToolSet()` (`voiceToolBridge.ts`) into a Realtime function-tool schema (tool names are sanitized `.`→`_` because Realtime function names disallow dots; built-in tool names are reserved so they can't be shadowed), and hands them to `RealtimeAPIClient.setExtensionVoiceTools()`. The client appends them to the session `tools` array (`buildSessionTools()`).
- Dispatch: any function call whose name is not a built-in routes through `RealtimeAPIClient`'s generic `onExtensionVoiceTool(namespacedName, args)` callback. `VoiceModeService` invokes the tool through the **existing extension execution path** (`handleExtensionTool`, the same route MCP uses), so the tool runs in the renderer with an `AIToolContext` (workspacePath, activeFilePath) mirroring the coding path.

Voice tools should generally be `scope: 'global'` and self-contained (low latency, no required editor mount) since the voice agent has no reliable active-file context.

### Core hook 2 — Voice session context providers

An extension registers `context.services.ai.registerVoiceContextProvider((ctx) => string | Promise<string>)` to inject text into the voice agent's session context at start (e.g. top-N grounding facts). Providers live in the renderer-side `VoiceContextProviderRegistry`; on voice session start the main process requests the concatenated, capped output over a one-shot request/response IPC (`voice-mode:collect-extension-context`) and appends it to `sessionContext` in `loadSessionContext`. Each provider's output and the combined total are capped (the Realtime context window is expensive); providers run highest-priority-first and a throwing provider is isolated.

Use a context provider for zero-latency grounding the agent should know up front; expose on-demand lookups as `voiceAgent: true` tools instead.

### Core hook 3 — Backend-module voice tools (no renderer hop)

Extension **backend modules** (utility-process runtimes) can also contribute voice/agent tools, without running their handler in the renderer. A backend module calls `services.registerMcpTools([{ name, description, inputSchema, voiceAgent }])`; the host stores them in a workspace-keyed `backendToolRegistry` (advertised as `<ext-short>.<name>`) and merges them into both the coding-agent MCP surface (`httpServer` ListTools/CallTool) and the voice tool set. A voice (or coding) call to a backend tool is dispatched **main→backend** via `handleBackendTool` → `PrivilegedExtensionHost.request(...)` — no renderer round-trip — so a native engine (e.g. better-sqlite3 + embeddings) answers in-process. Backend modules start/stop with the extension via `extensions/backendModuleLifecycle.ts` (start-on-enable, stop-on-disable, start-on-workspace-open).

### Grounding extension — Nimbalyst Memory (`com.nimbalyst.memory`)

The flagship consumer of the hooks above. Its backend module hosts the host-agnostic `MemoryEngine` (markdown indexer → rebuildable SQLite shadow index → hybrid dense+BM25+RRF retrieval) and registers `search_project_knowledge` / `recall` / `remember` (voice + coding) plus `expand` / `read_doc` / `status` (coding). Embeddings use OpenAI `text-embedding-3-small`, keyed only from the user's configured Nimbalyst OpenAI key (the `getApiKey` broker — never `process.env`). It indexes `design/**`, `docs/**`, `nimbalyst-local/plans/**`, the `CLAUDE.md` tree, and `nimbalyst-local/voice-memory/**`. A renderer-side voice context provider injects a short "you have a project memory — use these tools" note at session start (v1: static note; live top-N facts await a renderer→backend read bridge). This replaces the slow `ask_coding_agent` round-trip for grounded answers with a sub-second in-process lookup. Dev note: as a built-in extension its backend module is auto-granted (no consent UI); user-installed extensions raise a first-use native-code consent prompt instead.

**Brainstorm-loop tools (Phase 4).** The extension also closes the talk-it-through-on-a-bike-ride loop. Two host-agnostic backend voice tools — `get_latest_plan` (read back the most recently edited plan to summarize aloud) and `read_plan` (a plan by bare name or path) — let the agent summarize a just-written plan verbally; both cap their body for the Realtime budget. One Nimbalyst-specific renderer voice tool — `get_task_status` — answers "is it done yet?" by reading the active voice-linked session's `ai_sessions.status` (`running` / `waiting_for_input` / `idle` / `error`) through a new host API (`extensions:ai-get-task-status` → `ExtensionAIService.getTaskStatus()`), so the agent never blocks on the coding agent to report progress. Kickoff itself reuses the built-in `submit_agent_prompt` tool (the agent phrases `/design` and `/implement`); the extension's voice context provider injects the brainstorm→design→summarize→refine→implement choreography so the core voice prompt never assumes the memory tools exist.

## MCP Tools for Coding Agent

The coding agent (Claude Code) has access to two MCP tools for voice interaction, registered in `httpServer.ts`:

| MCP Tool | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `voice_agent_speak` | Send a text message to the voice agent for speech output. Uses `sendToVoiceAgent()` which calls `poc.sendUserMessage()`. Returns gracefully if no voice session is active. |
| `voice_agent_stop` | Programmatically stop the active voice session. Calls `stopVoiceSession()`. |

## System Prompt Injection

When a prompt is submitted via voice mode, the `isVoiceMode` flag and optional `voiceModeCodingAgentPrompt` are passed through the prompt queue to the provider.

In `buildClaudeCodeSystemPrompt()` (packages/runtime/src/ai/prompt.ts), when `isVoiceMode` is true:

1. Optional `voiceModeCodingAgentPrompt.prepend` is added before the voice section
2. A `## Voice Mode` section is appended explaining:
  - The user is interacting via voice mode
  - A voice assistant handles the conversation and relays requests
  - The `voice_agent_speak` MCP tool is available for spoken updates
3. Optional `voiceModeCodingAgentPrompt.append` is added after

Both ClaudeCodeProvider and OpenAICodexProvider extract `isVoiceMode` and `voiceModeCodingAgentPrompt` from the document context and pass them to the prompt builder.

## Project Summary

A workspace-specific, voice-friendly project summary lives at `nimbalyst-local/voice-project-summary.md`. When a voice session starts, `VoiceModeService.loadSessionContext` reads this file and appends its contents to the voice agent's session context, giving the voice assistant a quick overview it can reference during conversations.

Generation happens in the Voice Mode settings panel (`packages/electron/src/renderer/components/Settings/VoiceModePanel.tsx`):

1. The user clicks "Generate Project Summary".
2. A confirmation dialog explains that an agent session will be launched using the user's default agent (`defaultAgentModelAtom`).
3. On confirm, the renderer creates a normal AI session titled "Voice mode: project summary" via the `sessions:create` IPC, then sends a single prompt (`buildVoiceProjectSummaryPrompt()` in `voiceModeSummaryPrompt.ts`) via `ai:sendMessage`.
4. The agent reads whichever project files it considers useful and writes the result to `nimbalyst-local/voice-project-summary.md` using its Write tool.
5. The window switches to Agent mode and selects the new session so the user can watch it run.

There is no main-process IPC handler for summary generation -- the agent does the work through its existing tooling. If no agent is configured (`defaultAgentModel` is empty), the button is disabled and the panel shows a link into the AI Models settings instead. The previous direct-Anthropic-API implementation was removed because it required a chat API key the user might not have, even though voice mode itself only requires an OpenAI key.

## Workspace Command Context

At every desktop voice-session start, `VoiceModeService` clears the shared `AgentWorkflowService` snapshot, reads the same provider-aware command catalog used by the composer, and adds a bounded list of validated slash-command names to the Realtime system instructions. This makes newly added, removed, or renamed workspace commands visible on the next voice session even when they changed inside the catalog's normal cache window; command bodies, descriptions, source paths, allowed tools, and other file-derived metadata are deliberately excluded from the voice prompt.

## Session Persistence

Voice mode maintains two separate but linked sessions in the database:

### Voice Session (ai_sessions)

- Created with ID format `voice-{timestamp}-{random}` and provider `openai-realtime`
- Transcript entries stored in `ai_agent_messages` incrementally as they arrive
- Metadata (linked coding session ID, token usage, duration) stored in the session's metadata JSONB field
- Sessions can be **resumed**: if a voice session for the same workspace was updated within the last 30 minutes (`VOICE_SESSION_TIMEOUT_MS`), new transcript entries append to it instead of creating a new session
- Diagnostic entries (file changes, state transitions) are written with `[system]` prefix and `diag-` ID prefix
- Tool calls the voice agent makes (memory lookups, `ask_coding_agent`, etc.) are written as `voiceToolCall` JSON entries with a `tool-` ID prefix — emitted from `RealtimeAPIClient.handleFunctionCall` (started) and `sendFunctionCallResult` (completed), forwarded via `voice-mode:tool-call` IPC, and rendered as real tool widgets by `VoiceRawParser`. Previously these executed silently and were invisible in the transcript.

### Linked Coding Session (ai_sessions)

- The regular coding session the user was viewing when voice started
- Voice commands (submit_agent_prompt, ask_coding_agent) target this session
- If the user switches active sessions while voice is active, `voiceModeListeners` updates the linked session ID and notifies the main process

## Voice Session Following

When voice is active and the user switches coding sessions:

1. `voiceModeListeners` subscribes to `activeSessionIdAtom`
2. On change, updates `voiceActiveSessionIdAtom` to the new session ID
3. Sends `voice-mode:update-linked-session` IPC with the new session ID and name
4. `VoiceModeService` updates `activeVoiceSession.sessionId` and injects context to the voice agent: `[INTERNAL: User switched to session "name"]`
5. VoiceModeButton's module-level `activeVoiceSessionId` is synced via the `onLinkedSessionChanged` callback

## Editor Context Tracking

While voice is active, the currently viewed file is tracked and reported to the voice agent:

1. `voiceModeListeners` subscribes to `activeTabIdAtom`, `activeSessionIdAtom`, and `windowModeAtom`
2. On change (debounced 300ms), computes the current file path
3. If different from `voiceLastReportedFileAtom`, sends `voice-mode:editor-context-changed` IPC
4. `VoiceModeService` calls `poc.injectContext()` with `[INTERNAL: User is now viewing {filename}]`
5. The voice agent silently notes this for context without announcing it

## Audio Pipeline

### Capture (Renderer)

`AudioCapture` uses `getUserMedia` with 24kHz mono, echo cancellation, noise suppression, and auto gain control. A `ScriptProcessorNode` (buffer size 4096 = ~170ms) converts Float32 samples to PCM16 Int16, base64-encodes the result, and passes it to the callback.

Audio is gated by listen state in `VoiceModeButton`: the callback only sends IPC when `voiceListenStateAtom === 'listening'`.

### Playback (Renderer)

`AudioPlayback` decodes base64 PCM16 to Float32, creates `AudioBuffer` objects, and schedules them via `AudioBufferSourceNode`. Audio is routed through a `MediaStreamAudioDestinationNode` connected to an `<audio>` element -- this makes the output visible to the browser's echo cancellation (AEC), preventing the assistant's voice from being picked up by the microphone.

Playback is interrupted on `voice-mode:interrupt` events (VAD detected user speech) by stopping all scheduled sources and clearing the queue.

### Echo Cancellation on iOS (native)

The native iOS voice agent does not rely on browser AEC. `packages/ios/NimbalystNative/Sources/Voice/AudioPipeline.swift` runs a single `kAudioUnitSubType_VoiceProcessingIO` (VPIO) audio unit: microphone capture comes in on bus 1 (48kHz PCM16), and assistant playback is rendered through a render callback on bus 0. Because playback flows through the same unit that captures, VPIO uses the bus 0 output signal as its echo-cancellation reference, so Apple's AEC subtracts the assistant's own voice from the mic — enabling barge-in without the agent interrupting itself.

Because AEC is imperfect on open speakers, both platforms route every VAD `speech_started` through a shared barge-in policy (`voiceBargeInPolicy.ts` / `BargeInPolicy.swift`, NIM-1314). A trigger while agent audio is audibly playing is **echo-suspect**: instead of interrupting immediately, playback continues through a 500ms probation window; if the speech ends inside it (an echo blip) nothing happens, and if it persists (a real barge-in) the interrupt fires with truncation measured at fire time. Triggers while silent interrupt immediately. Server-side, responses are gated (`create_response`/`interrupt_response=false`) while agent audio plays. All decisions are logged with `[barge-in]` tags including a per-session summary (echo-suspect vs genuine vs suppressed counts).

## Settings

Voice mode settings are stored in `nimbalyst-settings` electron-store (not `ai-settings`) under the `voiceMode` key.

| Setting | Type | Default | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `enabled` | `boolean` | `false` | Show/hide the voice mode button |
| `voice` | `VoiceId` | `'alloy'` | OpenAI Realtime voice (alloy, ash, ballad, coral, echo, sage, shimmer, verse, marin, cedar) |
| `model` | `RealtimeModel` | `'gpt-realtime-2'` | Realtime speech-to-speech model. Falls back to `gpt-realtime` automatically if the account/region lacks access |
| `reasoningEffort` | `RealtimeReasoningEffort` | `'low'` | Reasoning throttle (minimal/low/medium/high/xhigh). Higher = smarter but slower. Applies to gpt-realtime-2 |
| `turnDetection.mode` | `'server_vad' \ | 'push_to_talk'` | `'server_vad'` | Automatic voice detection or manual |
| `turnDetection.vadThreshold` | `number` | `0.5` | VAD sensitivity (0.0-1.0, higher = less sensitive) |
| `turnDetection.silenceDuration` | `number` | `500` | Silence duration (ms) before processing |
| `turnDetection.interruptible` | `boolean` | `true` | Whether user can interrupt assistant |
| `voiceAgentPrompt` | `SystemPromptConfig` | `{}` | Custom prepend/append for voice agent system prompt |
| `codingAgentPrompt` | `SystemPromptConfig` | `{}` | Custom prepend/append for coding agent when in voice mode |
| `submitDelayMs` | `number` | `3000` | Delay before auto-submitting voice commands (0 = immediate) |
| `listenWindowMs` | `number` | `15000` | How long to keep listening after speech ends before sleeping |

## Callback Registration Pattern

Voice mode uses a module-level callback pattern to bridge centralized listeners with component-specific behavior, avoiding direct IPC subscriptions in components:

1. `voiceModeState.ts` exports `register*Callback()` and `get*Callback()` pairs
2. `VoiceModeButton` registers callbacks on module load via `registerVoiceCallbacks()`
3. `voiceModeListeners.ts` invokes callbacks via getters when IPC events arrive

This follows the project's centralized listener architecture: components never subscribe to IPC directly; centralized listeners update atoms, and components read from atoms.

## Inactivity Management

Two independent timers manage voice session lifecycle:

1. **Listen window timer** (renderer, `voiceModeListeners.ts`): Transitions from `listening` to `sleeping` after configurable inactivity period. Does not disconnect the WebSocket.

2. **Inactivity monitor** (main, `RealtimeAPIClient.ts`): Disconnects the WebSocket entirely after 5 minutes of inactivity (`INACTIVITY_TIMEOUT_MS`). Suspended when listen state is sleeping (renderer notifies via `voice-mode:listen-state-changed`).

## Connection Reliability (Reconnect / Resume)

A dropped socket no longer silently ends voice mode. `RealtimeAPIClient` distinguishes intentional disconnects (`user_stopped`, inactivity `timeout`) from unexpected ones:

- On an unexpected `close`/`error` after the socket was open, it reconnects with bounded exponential backoff (`RECONNECT_BASE_DELAY_MS` 500ms, doubling, capped at `RECONNECT_MAX_DELAY_MS` 8s, up to `MAX_RECONNECT_ATTEMPTS` = 5).
- On reconnect, `session.created` re-runs `updateSession()` which re-sends the **identical** voice/model/reasoning/instructions, so recovery is inaudible. Token-usage accumulators are instance fields and survive the reconnect (the live indicator doesn't reset).
- The renderer shows a transient "reconnecting…" state (`voiceReconnectingAtom`, set from `voice-mode:reconnecting`, cleared on `voice-mode:reconnected`). A hard `voice-mode:error` is emitted only after retries are exhausted.

## Model Selection & Fallback

Voice mode defaults to `gpt-realtime-2` (GPT-5-class reasoning, 128K context, more consistent voice rendering). If the initial socket fails to open on `gpt-realtime-2` (no account/region access), the client falls back **once** to `gpt-realtime`, logs a warning, and emits the `voice_model_fallback` analytics event. The fallback model is also manually selectable. `supportsAsyncFunctionCalls()` (true only for gpt-realtime-2) gates the async `submit_agent_prompt` path; the fallback uses the legacy queue + wake path.

The output voice is set once in `session.update` and intentionally **not** re-asserted on each `response.create` — gpt-realtime-2 renders a consistent voice for the whole session. The `session.updated` handler compares the server-reported voice against the requested voice and emits `voice_voice_mismatch` if they diverge, turning drift into a measurable signal.

`createResponse()` guards against an already-active response (`hasActiveResponse`, set optimistically on send and on `response.created`, cleared on `response.done`/cancel). The method is invoked from several async paths (tool results, wake / task-complete messages, interactive-prompt injection); without the guard a trigger arriving mid-turn would start a **second overlapping response**, i.e. two concurrent audio renderings that — under the expressive voices (marin/cedar) — are heard as the voice "switching" mid-turn. This is distinct from the configured voice being wrong: the session and per-response voice are both correctly pinned; the perceived switch comes from overlap.

## Spoken Language

The voice agent's spoken language is pinned to the desktop's **preferred agent language** setting (`preferredAgentLanguage`, configured in AI Models settings) so it never auto-detects or drifts into a different language at startup. The pin is applied as a final `LANGUAGE: Always speak to the user in <language>...` directive appended to the session instructions in `RealtimeAPIClient.updateSession()` (desktop) and `VoiceAgent.buildCompactInstructions()` (iOS). When no preference is set, both fall back to **English**.

On iOS the setting arrives via settings sync: `preferredAgentLanguage` is a top-level field on `SyncedSettings`, persisted into `VoiceModeSettings.language` (UserDefaults) when the desktop pushes settings. Because the directive lives in `updateSession()`, it is re-sent identically on reconnect, like voice/model/reasoning.

## Mobile (iOS) Voice Agent

The iOS app runs its own on-device voice agent (`packages/ios/.../Voice/VoiceAgent.swift` + the floating `VoiceOverlay`), reusing the same tool surface.

`RealtimeClient.swift` mirrors the desktop Realtime session config: `gpt-realtime-2` with the same one-shot fallback to `gpt-realtime` (a connection that dies before `session.created` retries once on the fallback), `gpt-realtime-whisper` streaming transcription, `reasoning.effort=low`, semantic_vad turn detection with response gating, and far-field noise reduction. The output voice comes from `VoiceModeSettings.voice` (Settings picker, or synced from the desktop's voice preference). Intentional divergences, each commented in code: the instructions length cap is model-aware (8000 chars on gpt-realtime-2, 2000 on the fallback where longer instructions crash audio generation); `submit_agent_prompt` is never a deferred call (the prompt relays over the sync channel and completion arrives as a separate broadcast, so the call can't stay open); and there is no exponential-backoff reconnect (connection loss tears down voice mode; the user re-taps the mic).

Two mobile-specific behaviors:

- **Create-session navigation.** `create_session` is fire-and-forget to the desktop over the index sync channel; the desktop replies with a `createSessionResponseBroadcast` carrying the `requestId` + new `sessionId`. `VoiceAgent` remembers the `requestId` it sent and `consumePendingCreateSession(requestId:)` matches the response, so **only the device that asked** navigates. `AppState.navigateWhenSessionAvailable` waits for the session row to arrive via index sync, then sets `voiceNavigationRequest`, which the iPhone stack and iPad split view observe to open the session.
- **Tool-call indicator.** `VoiceAgent.currentToolCall` is set when `RealtimeClient.onFunctionCall` fires and cleared by the new `onFunctionResultSent(callId)` hook (so async tools stay lit until they finish). While set, `VoiceOverlay` pulses the outer ring (amber) and shows a per-tool SF Symbol badge in the mic's corner.
