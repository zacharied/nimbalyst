# PostHog Events Reference

This document catalogs all PostHog analytics events tracked in Nimbalyst. **This document MUST be updated whenever PostHog events are added, modified, or removed.**

## Version Tracking

Each event table includes columns tracking when events were first added and when significant changes were made. This helps understand the data available in PostHog at different points in time.

### Column Definitions

| Column | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **First Added (Public)** | The first public release version where this event was included. Events added before v0.45.25 (the first public alpha) show v0.45.25. |
| **Significant Changes** | Notable modifications to how the event is tracked (new properties, behavior changes, bug fixes). Each entry should include the version and a brief description. |

### How to Fill In These Columns

When adding or modifying events:

1. **For new events being added:**
  - If the change is not yet released publicly, use: `(pending release as of <short-commit-hash>)`
  - Example: `(pending release as of abc1234)`
  - Once released, update to the actual public version: `v0.49.14`

2. **For modifications to existing events:**
  - Add an entry to the "Significant Changes" column
  - Format: `v0.X.Y: <brief description>`
  - Multiple changes should be separated by `<br/>`
  - Example: `v0.48.13: Added slashCommandName property<br/>v0.47.2: Added hasAttachments property`

3. **Determining the public release version:**
  - Check which public release contains your commit: `git tag --contains <commit-hash> --sort=version:refname | head -1`
  - https://github.com/Nimbalyst/nimbalyst/releases)Then verify if that version is a public release (check https://github.com/Nimbalyst/nimbalyst/releases)
  - If the internal version isn't publicly released yet, find the next public release that contains it

4. **Public release versions** (as of this writing):
  - v0.45.25 (2025-11-14) - First public alpha
  - v0.45.26 (2025-11-14)
  - v0.45.34 (2025-11-19)
  - v0.46.0 (2025-11-24)
  - v0.46.1 (2025-11-25)
  - v0.47.2 (2025-12-10)
  - v0.48.13 (2025-12-17)
  - v0.49.14 (2025-12-27)
  - Check https://github.com/Nimbalyst/nimbalyst/releases for the latest list

## Overview

Nimbalyst uses PostHog for anonymous usage analytics with two tracking contexts:
- **Main Process**: Server-side events via `AnalyticsService.getInstance().sendEvent()`
- **Renderer Process**: Client-side events via `usePostHog()` hook from posthog-js/react

All events include `$session_id` property automatically. Dev users are marked with `is_dev_user: true` via `$set_once`.

#### Known Error IDs

The `known_error` event uses an `errorId` property to identify specific error conditions. This allows us to track patterns of known issues without creating a separate event for each one.

| Event Name | File(s) | Trigger | Properties | First Added (Public) | Significant Changes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `update_toast_shown` | `updateListeners.ts` -> `AnalyticsHandlers.ts` | Update available toast actually displayed to user (after suppression checks pass). Fires at most once per distinct `newVersion` per app run -- not on every electron-updater 'update-available' callback, which re-fires hourly. | `release_channel` (stable/alpha)<br/>`new_version` | (pending release) | (pending release): Moved fire site from `autoUpdater.ts` (main) to `updateListeners.ts` (renderer); (pending release): Tightened dedup to once-per-version-per-run because the prior state-based guard still re-fired after the toast dismissed back to 'idle'. |

| `update_install_initiated` | `autoUpdater.ts` | User clicks relaunch to install update | `new_version` | (pending release) |  |
| `update_error` | `autoUpdater.ts` | Error during update check, download, or install. Background-check path is deduped to once per distinct (`stage`, `error_type`) per app run; the key resets on a successful `update-available` or `update-not-available` so a transient error that recurs after the network heals is still captured. The download-failure branch in the manual toast flow is not deduped. | `stage` (check/download/install)<br/>`error_type` (network/permission/disk_space/signature/unknown)<br/>`release_channel` (stable/alpha) | (pending release) | (pending release): Added (`stage`, `error_type`) dedup on the background path because hourly auto-checks were re-firing the same network/check error every poll. |

| `user_role` | `string` | `useOnboarding.ts` | User's role as raw enum value (`developer`, `product_manager`, `designer`, `writer`, `researcher`, `marketing`, `sales`, `finance`, `student`, `hobbyist`, `other`). Cohorts and breakdowns filter on these exact values. |
| `custom_role_text` | `string` | `useOnboarding.ts` | Free-text role typed by the user when they picked "Other" (only set in that case) |

| `is_dev_user` | `boolean` | `AnalyticsService.ts` | Set via `$set_once` - true for development/non-official builds |
| `is_dev_install` | `boolean` | `AnalyticsService.ts` | Set via `$set_once` - true if installed from dev build |
| `cpu_arch` | `string` | `AnalyticsService.ts` | `process.arch` value (`arm64`, `x64`, `ia32`, etc.) - set on each session start via `$set` |
| `nimbalyst_mobile_version` | `string` | Mobile `main.tsx` | Mobile app version (iOS/Android) |

## Surveys

Surveys are configured in PostHog and can be either popover (shown in-app) or API (programmatically submitted).

| Survey ID | Name | Type | Questions | Submitted From |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| ~~`019becdc-8139-0000-0946-e76c18c36ef7`~~ | ~~Onboarding Profile Survey~~ | ~~API~~ | ~~1. What best describes your role?<br/>2. How did you hear about Nimbalyst?~~ | ~~`useOnboarding.ts`~~ — **REMOVED**: replaced by `onboarding_completed` custom event |

## Privacy Requirements

All events MUST follow these privacy rules:

1. **Never include PII**: No usernames, emails, IP addresses, or identifying information
2. **No file paths**: Use categories/buckets instead of actual paths
3. **No API keys**: Never include authentication tokens or credentials
4. **Anonymous distinctId**: Use auto-generated anonymous ID, never override
5. **Categorical properties**: Use bucketed values (small/medium/large) instead of exact values

## Development vs Production

- **Dev users**: Automatically marked with `is_dev_user: true` property (via `$set_once`)
- **Dev builds**: Any non-official build (local builds, development mode)
- **Official builds**: Created by GitHub release workflow with `OFFICIAL_BUILD=true`
- **Filtering**: Use `WHERE is_dev_user != true` in PostHog to exclude dev users

## Adding New Events

When adding new events:

1. **Choose the right context**: Main process (AnalyticsService) or renderer (usePostHog)
2. **Follow naming conventions**: Use `snake_case`, `noun_verb` pattern
3. **Use categorical properties**: Bucket values instead of exact numbers
4. **Update this document**: Add the event to the appropriate table with version columns:
  - Set "First Added (Public)" to `(pending release as of <commit-hash>)` until publicly released
  - Leave "Significant Changes" empty for new events
5. **Document in code**: Add comment explaining what the event tracks
6. **When modifying events**: Add entry to "Significant Changes" column (see Version Tracking section)
