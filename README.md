# Nimbalyst is the visual workspace for building with Codex and Claude Code

[Nimbalyst](https://nimbalyst.com) is a free, open-source, local, interactive visual editor & session/task manager for developers, product managers, designers, builders. 
- Maximize speed, bandwidth, and context with Codex, Claude Code, Opencode (alpha), Copilot (alpha) by collaborating visually on integrated files, sessions, and tasks
- Iterate visually with coding agents in your markdown, mockups, diagrams, csv, Excalidraw, data models, and code. Approve the coding agent's changes in red/green WYSIWYG, edit, annotate.
- Manage multiple sessions in parallel and in kanban. Search, resume, link sessions to files and files to sessions. For developers we include git management, AI commit, workstreams, worktrees, and terminal.
- Manage tasks. Keep track of your plans, bugs, todos, etc. Have the agent edit tasks and items, add them, move them, and execute them. Humans see and edit this as well.
- Extend Nimbalyst. Build your own custom editors and visual interfaces integrated with the rest of Nimbalyst and your agents.
- Mobile app. Start, manage, and respond to your Codex and Claude Code sessions while on the go.

**Mobile App**
- Session dashboard: see which agents need you and which are still working
- Reply to questions via text or voice, agents resume immediately
- Visual diff review: swipe through changes, tap to approve
- Queue next tasks: keep the pipeline full, don't let agents sit idle
- Push notifications: agents tell you when they need you

**Open** storage of content and status in markdown, workflow in slash commands, and plain files on disk or in git.

**Extension System**
- Pluggable editors for any file type. Every editor (including built-ins) goes through the same `EditorHost` contract, so custom editors are first-class.
- Current extensions include an Astro website editor, visual git log, mindmap, slides, and a 3D object editor.

2. **Write in markdown** — write/edit in the WYSIWYG editor
3. **Use the AI assistant** — ask AI to research, edit the document, work across your files
4. **Accept/reject AI changes** — step through suggested AI edits and accept or reject
5. **Work in Agent Manager** — switch to the agent manager view and run multiple agent sessions in parallel
6. **Search/resume sessions** — search and resume sessions, manage your work

## Auto-Updates

Nimbalyst automatically checks for updates and notifies you when a new version is available. You can also manually check via Help → Check for Updates.

By default, fresh installs are on the **stable** release channel and only receive promoted releases. If you want early-access builds, switch to the **alpha** channel under **Settings → Advanced → Release Channel**. Alpha builds are rougher and may break; revert to stable any time.

## Telemetry

Nimbalyst sends **anonymous usage analytics** to PostHog so we can understand how the app is used and prioritize improvements. We never collect:

- Usernames, emails, or IP addresses (no PII)
- File contents or file paths (categorized buckets only)
- API keys or authentication tokens
- Document, session, or chat content

A randomly-generated anonymous ID is used to correlate events from the same install. You can opt out at any time in **Settings → Advanced → Analytics**.

For the complete list of every event we send and its properties, see [POSTHOG_EVENTS.md](./docs/POSTHOG_EVENTS.md). For the privacy rules our analytics code follows, see [ANALYTICS_GUIDE.md](./docs/ANALYTICS_GUIDE.md).

## Building from Source

Nimbalyst is a TypeScript / Electron monorepo using npm workspaces.

```bash
# Install dependencies (npm 7+ required)
npm install

# Start the Electron app in dev mode
cd packages/electron && npm run dev

# Build a local Mac binary
cd packages/electron && npm run build:mac:local
```

Major workspaces:

- `packages/ios` — Native iOS app (SwiftUI)
- `packages/electron` — Desktop application (Electron)
- `packages/runtime` — Cross-platform runtime services (AI, sync, Lexical editor)
- `packages/collab-protocol` — Wire-format types for the collaboration sync protocol (shared with the sync server)
- `packages/extension-sdk` — Extension development kit
- `packages/extensions` — Built-in extensions

The collaboration sync server (talked to at `wss://sync.nimbalyst.com`) is a separate project.
